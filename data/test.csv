The food is usually pretty good from the grill - salad is ok. The service/attitude of some of the staff could use some improvement though/ I see comments below echoing the grill cook's demeanor - I went there today and he was pretty rude. Other times I've gone and have been annoyed at the checkout situation, i.e. I'm standing in line on one side behind a person, and as soon as they're finished checking out, I'm told to go to the other side.

It has an eclectic atmosphere, and a cozy patio with live acoustic music. That made the experience fun, however the food was less than memorable. We ordered the cheese board, which was kinda boring with a couple pieces of cheese and unexciting bread. I'm not a wine conesuirre, but for a wine bar with a casual atmosphere I found the prices a bit high. I also found out this place is owned by the same owners as Jalape√±o Inferno which I love.

My sister and I stopped by before eating here to check the cleanliness and it was very clean. Walking in we questioned the price and they explained it to use very clearly. 

So my family and I decided to eat her for lunch. Customer service is great! We had waiters checking up on us every so often, checking if we needed more drinks, side orders, or meats. They even helped us cook our meats (which for me is helpful esp since some meats take longer to cook).

The restaurant was a small place, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes without a reservation. I've been here a few times and have had a good experience consistently. 

We were craving sushi, so we ordered a huge boat of sushi. We were each given a small bowl of salad and miso soup soon afterwards. The soup didn't have that msg aftertaste you'd find at some places, and the dressing on the salad was just right; not too sour, not too sweet, not too bland, not too much. The sushi came in about 10 minutes, and for the amount that we ordered, that was pretty fast. We had an assortment of raw fish, including no tuna and hamachi, as well as raw squid, avocado, and sea urchin. All of it tasted fresh and delicious. The sushi didn't have too much rice like some places, and the fish servings were adequate. We also got a soft shell crab roll, which had avocado, cucumber and cream cheese. My family didn't like the cream cheese in it but I thought it was good so I ate all of it.

What I find stood out to me was that every time I've went with my family, they always bring us something random that's on the house. I'm not sure if that's something they do often or just with larger groups. They use ""scrap"" pieces of fish such as the bits of meat missed when filleting a fish and make it into something delicious. This time, they made a hot dish of salmon pieces with onions, bean sprouts, carrots and sauce. The salmon was done well but had bones in it. It was free though so I can't really complain. It's a nice touch, and I like the idea of not wasting food. 

Overall, this is probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants and I'd definitely come back another time.",2,N-Ed3ymvxpW27VpY4cn-Ag

For one, I'm really stoked that it's a buffet and I can eat as much as I want and that they have some pretty awesome selections! My favorites are when they have the fish and roast beef. They even have white rice to accommodate for the Hawaiians lol, however, it's kind of a hit or miss whether it'll be too wet or too dry. Sometimes I just go with the rice pilaf if they have it.

The only thing difficult about this buffet is waiting to be seated. They don't nearly have enough space to accommodate everyone that comes through and you can be waiting for a good while. Sad thing is, it's pretty big inside! They just have *that* many patrons. When you come, be prepared for a wait -or- head down early enough in the morning for breakfast before anyone else is up yet. Try to schedule all your meals before the peak rush times and you'll hopefully get in faster.",1,6nXgmi-9TBBEVEyTKEeIsQ

The tacos looked good and the skillet enchilada was very unique, and had not seen enchiladas served like this anywhere else.  I personally like enchiladas and this skillet version looked fabulous but did not deliver on taste, serving size (small) and even though we ordered chicken enchilada there was hardly any chicken.

TUESDAY WINGS AT BOOKERS!!!!  lb of wings for $4.99
THEY SMOKE THE WINGS!!!!

They had me at this selling point.  So a group of 10 at a table...now before I go on further, this turned out to be one of the worst wing nights we've ever had.  It even came to the point we were outside talking about how we will do our next chicken fry for July or August.  So for the few of us drinks came, for others they were waiting for quite a bit...meaning 20-25 minutes.  So not really starting off with a good experience.

So finally our drinks came and we look over the menu,  Everyone was coming to an agreement they were ready to order.  Unfortunately we were not attended to for 20 minutes.  This caused for one of us to approach the bar to have the bartender send over the waitress.  That took another 20 minutes til we got our order taken.

So we gave our orders to the waitress.  Keep in mind its 16 orders of wings.  There were 2 entree orders, 5 side orders of jalapeno mac and cheese, and an order of fries.  Not to bad of an order for the night and drinks.

So by now its coming to an hour and 15 minutes, we are antsy for our food.  Our waitress came out to tell us our food is coming and explained that instead of individual plates for the wings, it would be grouped.  This meaning wings would be on a platter.  She also indicated the wings are not tossed in sauce, individual sauce cups will be given.

So we nod and smile and finally the food starts coming out, they give 3 platters of wings and a platter of various sauces in a cup.  For the people who ordered salt and pepper wings, the shakers are in the middle of the table.  Salt and pepper the wings themselves....FAIL!!!!!  The girl who dropped off the sauces to us didn't even take the time to tell us which sauce was which:  Buffalo, Carolina, Kansas City, or Maple Bourbon....FAIL!!!!  Don't get me wrong I think we were able to figure the sauces out from sampling.

So as we are eating, we notice that the wings were gone pretty fast.  Now out of the 10 of us, 6 of us order 2 lbs of wings.  Now don't think we were being petty but the amount of wings we ate in total came up to approx 75 wings.  I asked the waitress how many wings usually come with a pound.  she advised 8-10 wings.  so in my calculation that would be based on 8 wings each 128 pieces.  So if  ""WE ARE COUNTING WINGS"" per the manager we are still short 51 wings.  As the waitress was about to clear our table, I asked her about the wings and that we may short wings as customer.  She asked if we wanted more, but we decided that what ever was brought out to us they can charge, what was not brought, just take it off the bill.

15 minutes later this guy with his ball cap backwards approaches us.  He indicated he was the manager, cool, brought to his attention we might short of wings in our order.  He gave us the same option for them to bring out the remaining wings or what we would like.  We just asked if they could remove the wings that were not brought out.  He then turned and may have muttered the f-bomb.  I wasn't the only one who heard, but also another person.

So we are sitting at our table, the table hasn't been cleared.  We are waiting for our bill.  The waitress comes and asks how many orders need to come off the bill.  We didn't know what to say as how do you measure a pound out by wings that are already eaten.  So we went off by their estimates of wings per order ratio.  8-10.  Unfortunately an agreement could not be made of how many orders to be taken off.  So essentially it was agree 8 orders of wings to be charged.  So the waitress was gonna seperate the bill.  The bill came back with us being charged 9 orders.  We asked if it was 8 and she said she would make the correction.

Another 20 minutes roll and the manager comes back and asks if we have finished counting wings....seriously ok, yah I can take a joke.  But I can't speak for the other people and it came down to 2 guys at our table vs the manager, I was stuck in between.  So the manager was saying we wanted him to take off another order of wings.  He even said he already taken off half the bill???  Umm lets see 5 bucks times 8 orders....$40...Thats not half the orders we made.  Pretty much he indicated to us he will get the bill corrected and have us leave their establishment....Really?  

Ok, so yah we were not feeling it so we got the bill which the waitress seperated for us.  There were issues with certain orders mixed with other peoples bills...lets just pay and get the hell out.

So after reading this I hope you didn't spend 2 hours and 30 minutes reading this because that was how long it was for our experience with Bookers.  

You know whats even funny, before we even went, talked about the all you can eat crab special,  sundays $42.95, not no more.  3 of us that were planning on going.  Thats approx 126.00 for food, plus drinks and tip not being spent there.

God bless and happy eating....somewhere else!!!",4,UuBW51xKZqbmm6J-KKIp3w

Goes to show what happens when you put all your faith in what either the AZ Republic or the New Times say.

I walked into Circles all amped to spend some serious dough on music, and then within seconds my music high came crashing down with a huge thud. The whole setup in this joint was off, and it felt more like a Wherehouse from the early 90's than a record store in the mid-00's. 

Musica Latina? Hmm. Only if you're into reggeton, ranchero, or mariachi music. Or Shakira. All the awesome Latin Alternative artists? None of them exist here. A lot of awesome American alternative artists don't exist here either. And don't bother trying to find MC Solaar or Asian Dub Foundation. This, I found out soon enough, isn't Amoeba.

Defeated, I wandered into the classical room. And then wandered back out in 1 minute and out the door and into my car. 

What potential this place has. And what a disappointing place it actually is. Oh well. Back to iTunes I go.",6,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ

When I walked in I was amazed on just how much of a transformation this place had to undergo to change from a Chinese restaurant to the best new ""Meat Factory"" in Charlotte, NC. First off the bar is stacked (I feel like a jock in high school writing/saying that) with drinks out the wazoo and the bartender knows what he is doing. He's a mixologist. The drink I tried was called, Parkside Fizz: New Amsterdam Vodka, Lemon, Orgeat, Mint, Soda, Minty but good. The ambiance and decor of Block & Grinder will make any restaurant decorator drool, it's like your eating in the butcher shop ; which you are. I wouldn't be surprised is other restaurants come here to get there meat ground. 
Alright enough of that on to my meal. I decided to switch things up and order the lamb burger. BEST DAMN LAMB BURGER I EVER HAD. Enough said. The lamb was juicy, succulent, savory,  and just delicious.  I didn't have to add any type of disguise to my burger at all; no ketchup, mustard, mayo anything. The feta cheese was the perfect accent to this burger. The only thing that threw me off was my girlfriend and her friend screaming about how great the bacon was just because they made their own bacon on the premises.

I'm a beginning rider and I never once encountered the least bit of annoyance from either of these gentlemen when I asked the fifty thousand questions I had lined for them. I had been to other cycle shops around the Henderson and Vegas valley and none of the other competitors had customer service that was as outstanding and or personable as Jt's. I work for the service industry and Jt's Service is what we would refer to as 5 star 5 diamond rated.,1,6AIFu4YpVYkqA5cKQ3ZIyA
ky6g1f4aGY3LraNlbzEhEA,0,2016-04-01 17:55:42,0,O76ROCPo1LyPl8n2KEpftg,"I hear advertisements for this store on the radio every day, and I now am a firm believer that they are true to their claims. I have the most beautiful engagement ring, thanks to my fiance and the staff at Diamonds Direct. I honestly never imagined that my fiance could acquire such an exquisite piece, at such an incredible price. I will have to ask him to leave a review himself, so you get all the details of his amazing experience at this store, but I can personally say I've had nothing but great experiences.

As it turns out, the ring was too small for my finger, so I took it in to get sized. Jennifer was more than happy to help me, and they actually sized it for me THAT DAY, free of charge, so I didn't have to go more than a day without it! Then I realized that I had sized it a little too big (it may be a bit top heavy, but who would complain about that), and I went back to Jennifer to have the ""speed bumps"" soldered on. Since it was the holidays, there was a bit of a wait, so I made an appointment for a few weeks out, dropped it off on the day of the appointment, and picked it up the very next day. Again, 100% free of charge, and such little effort on my part. And now it fits and looks like a dream.

Every time I walk in the store, I'm immediately greeted with a smile and an inquiry about what I'm there for. Sometimes, when they're really busy, I have to wait a little while, but to me, a wait means they're taking their time with each customer and not rushing them through the process. Ring cleanings are always free of charge, they will work to repair any issues you may have with the jewelry (again, free of charge), the quality of their jewelry is top notch, and I have yet to encounter an unfriendly or snobby employee, as previous reviews suggested.

We recently went back to purchase our wedding bands together, and despite our VERY tight budgets (hello, wedding planning), Carrie was happy to help us find exactly what we want, she spent quite a good bit of time with us while we waffled between a few selections, and we couldn't be happier with our end result!

I have now recommended this store to a few friends, who have also gone in and had fabulous experiences. I would recommend everyone give them a try, and if you have to wait a little while, just know that when it's your turn, you will be given all the time and attention you need.",0,nXYcnEr4IICOH5TkizZY4w

The place was huge, dry and wet market and meat and seafood market in one place. Multiple aisles with food from different countries eg. Argentinian, Sri Lankan..., it's really like being on a tour. I believe the owner is Vietnamese but i really like that the products that he sells branch out and cater multiculturally, giving this store an international flair in the Valley.

The vegetable section, though not always fresh, offers a lot of variety. If you're looking for ingredients for your Pho soup, this is the place.

They have frozen seafood and also live fish and sometimes seasonal crab and lobster  for sale on a large glass aquarium which is often a source of amusement for kids. I usually have my tilapia cleaned, cut and fried on their frying station.

Expect less expensive meat (chicken, pork and beef) here because they packaged it on their own. Moreso, expect oxtail, chicken liver and other non traditional fares to be on display for the culinary hippies.

Curiosity awaits the eye when one stops and checks out the items on their open freezer i.e. frozen banana leaves, frozen fish and shrimp balls....

I am giving this place a 4 stars because i really feel at home and gastronomically creative when i shop here. My only recommendation to the management is to train their cashier to be more welcoming and greetful, because a smile goes a long way for a repeat and satisfied customer.",4,jPRmiThUODYcju6jtusAcw

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink/stove/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains/shades
- washer/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots/pans/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",6,tCfKY7zsd4a5JKTEoFQgfQ

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice ""as your hostess about that.""  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg. 

I would have contacted this place directly through email but their site does not have an easily accessible email address.

The brown bread Outback is known for was okay, but I prefer the slightly sweet brown bread from Cheesecake Factory.  The blooming onion, which we thought we liked so much in the past, has lost its luster.  Too much for two people and neither of us liked the dipping sauce.

She was very thorough and spent quit a bit of time reviewing the colonoscopy prep with me. The financial person also explained my benefits at length (anesthesiology is not contracted with BCBS, FYI).

Another nurse called several days prior to the procedure to go over the information again and ask if I had any questions. 

I was expected to arrive at 2pm for my procedure, which was scheduled at 3pm. I guess they were early and I was quick, because I was done with my procedure and in recovery by 245pm.

Our waiter explained how right now they had a special menu for the chef which owns the restaurant (Alain Ducasse) and that we should order from that since it was ""better"".

We ordered a few dishes:
Shrimp Cocktail appetizer - It was good, made us feel a little excited about the dinner.  Ironically it was the best dish and the only one we got not on the Alain Ducasse menu.

Boneless Ribeye - It was not good.  I felt like I paid $46 for a USDA select cut of meat.  It wasn't tender and the fat wasn't juicy.  I cook better steaks on a stove-top at home.

John Dory ""Meuniere"" - The fish was dry, overcooked, and way underseasoned.  This dish was only 1/2 eaten.

Here we go, HEAD TO HEAD COMPARISON:  Stayed at Encore one-year ago--slightly more stunning (bigger/more stylish rooms in comparison to ""Wynn"").  This is uber-luxury as all the reviews will signal to you.  A couple reviews below, a gentlemen suggested that he would stay ""someplace nicer"" next time to LV.  Sir, I would like to fight you--such a place does not exist!

Wynn (and Encore also) is impeccably clean, doesn't cater to children, and will cost you at each turn.  Room service/ minibar prices are out of sight.  We always eat a meal or two on the property and explore the Strip and Vegas for the rest (only so many meals you can schill before the receipts in your wallet start to haunt you).

The Wynn resort rooms were recently renovated in Fall, 2010, including updates on colorings of hallways, bedding, artwork, curtains in the room, and furniture upgrades. Spa (per the Wife) is lovely and service was top notch on a custom massage.  Nice ""private"" entry via the room elevators (Though she informs me that the spa at Encore feels more ""secluded"" vis-a-vis the Salon and people coming and going).

No real problem of note: the ludicrous $129 in minibar charges (ONLY 8 items!!) appeared on my television guest bill folio.  These were quickly removed with a single call to the front desk (and a single inquiry to me [""Sir is it possible that someone put anything/ moving anything in fridge?""  Me: ""No ma'am, we only dared examine the $12 bag of potato chips; we didn't even open the fridge during our stay!""].  This too is illustrative of the attitude you'll find--you're the boss, you just have to pay SW's price (which BTW, slow season rates continue to bewilder--midweek under $150 per night= absolute bargain).

Restaurants are top notch at both properties.  But ""Wynn's Casino""  has the advantage, IMO, on size, feel, traffic, and most of all--the only poker room between the properties is housed at Wynn's casino space.

SW- I admire you. You are a business hero; your personal style is iconic and I love to visit your world.  I confess that I actually watch your Wynn promo [NOTE: yes, i said ""PROMO""] programming more than I watch television channels during the few moments of down time.",4,6pJICQMKi7CjMIKU-y9oTQ

I can't say the same for the artist lineup...it caters to a more conservative, older crowd (I guess). But this review isn't about the booking.

Over the years, I have seen a few concerts here. I have sat in both the pavilion and lawn. It's basically a mini-blossom, but way more relaxed. The place is small, so any seat in the pavilion is a good seat. The lawn is very small as well, so you are still in a good spot there. I recently saw Fiona Apple in the lawn and we were happy with our location. It's not like Blossom, where the lawn is a gazillion miles away and you can't hear anything. It was also very comfortable due to a steep slope. We were fine without chairs.

What I really noticed as far as differences between Cain Park and other larger venues was the RULES. OMG, you can actually bring a blanket if you are sitting on the lawn! And I didn't get a full body cavity search on the way in. You are allowed to bring in a cooler and beverages. I'm guessing you can't bring in alcohol because they sell it, but it was nice to be able to bring water and things.

It's a bit confusing in terms of locations as it is located in the back of the casino and up an escalator. This isn't really too terrible since you can make a nice walk through the casino and do some people watching. 

The theater itself is very nice and looks to be recently upgraded. The food court area has two sides as does the hallways featuring the individual theater rooms. Customer service at ticket pick up, entry, and the food area was satisfactory as well. 

The actual auditorium seemed a bit outdated in terms of seats as they felt almost like airplane seats with close proximity to the person in front. BUT the actual screen and sound are phenomenal which warrants a 4 star rating.",6,gthdAFBTwFeOrPZQKnlvUg

I have to give much props to the staff though.  Me and my friends had our very own ""hangover"" moment where we drank a few too many everclear shots and lost one of our friends at the pool area.  We didn't realize he was missing until we got back to our room.  But instead of looking for him, we laughed about the situation and passed out (messed up i know, but we were drunk).  

Next thing we know, we get a knock on the door, and guess who it was?  Our missing drunk!  The staff at PH had found our friend walking around aimlessly in the casino with no shirt and no shoes completely inebriated.  They were nice enough to wheelchair him back to our room (free of charge).

The first time we were looking for a sports car for the summer.  There wasn't much on their lot but we wandered around for a few minutes.  A salesman came out and tried to sell us something with a beige interior (I hate beige).  When we said we weren't interested, he kept pushing for a reason until I told him I hated beige...to which he asked, ""why don't you like beige?""  I'm not even sure how to justify not liking a colour...  The second time we were looking for a small truck to replace my old one.  We asked about their trucks and the salesman said they had some in the back, but didn't offer to show us any.  When my husband asked, he informed us we could wander around and try to find one if we wanted, but he wasn't sure where they were exactly.  Then he tried to sell us on a big SUV instead.  We test drove it, hated it, told him it wasn't what we were looking for, and he proceeded to ask, ""well what can I do to get you into this SUV?""  Um nothing.

Also a build a bear type place where you can stuff and create your own animal. So I don't think it really can compare to places like LOL it's closer to John's incredible minus the bumper cars.

As soon as we walked in, we were treated like royalty. The host took our jackets and led us to a very nice booth table. Our server was really lovely and super attentive. She took her time explaining every dish to us in detail.

We decided to get a french onion soup to share and our server kindly had the kitchen split our app into two bowls. The soup was really good, loaded with melted cheese and not overly salty (I find French onion to be super laden with sodium most times). Yum!

For my main, I selected the salmon with cream sauce and crab plus shrimps and bae chose the NY strip peppercorn steak. Since entrees don't come with sides, we selected the truffled cauliflower mash to accompany. Bae said his steak was one of the best he has ever had. I really enjoyed my main - the salmon was cooked perfectly and the cream sauce with big pieces of crab was so so good. Bae didn't really enjoy the mash as he found the truffles too overpowering (!) so our server kindly brought us a side of horseradish mashed potatoes instead.

It's hard to get a table for more than 2 people here! It appears that most people come in pairs, and the only have about 10ish tables, and a high top for about 16 people. Of course, pairs get the priority cause it's easier to sit them down. For a table of four, you have to actually wait for a table of four to leave. If you're lucky, and two pairs leave side by side, you might get seated. 

Last call is 9:30pm, as they close at 10pm! There's also a last call for the dessert place beside them as well.... however, there's no warning for that. After waiting in line and being forced to stare at all the dessert, I didn't get any to lighten this experience and excite my palate after my mediocre experience. 

The Intense Clam Ramen was very good, but the Original and the Spicy Red ramen had a milky base that was unexpectedly strong. The Spicy Red was not spicy at all..... on top of that, as a fan of steaming hot food, the soup was only warm.

The noodles were firm! No choices like the other ramen spots. 

The Clam and Original came with two slices of pork but the Red came with pork bits with some beans. Compared to the other ramen places, this made it fairly overpriced in our opinion. Moreover, stick to the Signatures. 

The Pork Belly with Egg was a good value, and the Karaage was freshly fried. The Tamago was on par - very standard. 

For people who need quick service, they were able to ace that aspect. You can be in and out of there within 45mins of getting seated. Their staff are very nice as well, but I went for the food.

      I have been here zillion of times and Bellagio remains my favorite casino and hotel in Las Vegas. My parents celebrate their anniversary here every year for the last 10 years.

- The service here to M Life card is AMAZING. 

- I have the best host in the world, Mr. Steve Jackson VIP Casino host.

- The best wine selection in the whole US if not the world, managed by Wine Director Master Sommelier Jason Smith, 1 of the best in the world!!!

- Restaurants choice: hands down 1 of the best restaurants group in Vegas - Picasso ($100 millions worth of original 11 painting by Picasso, when can I get this close to the real thing?), Prime Steakhouse by Jean-Georges, Yellowtail sushi, Le Cirque, Circo, Sensi, Fix, and Michael Mina! 

- The water fountain, the best in the world!

- The service, the service, and the service - I always feel like a queen when I'm here!!!! 

         Now, before you LECTURE me about other hotels, read my reviews to see where I've stayed and dined at first OK... When I come to Vegas 6 times a year, I've stayed around every single new hotel there already! My heart will always be with Bellagio!",14,JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA

WHAT ""REAL"" SOUTHERN FEEL IS EVERYONE SAYING THEY GET FROM STEPPING INTO THIS PLACE?!?! 

My husband and I just left this place highly disappointed! So my husband who was hyped about this place (because some other people hyped him about this place) so we decided to give it a try since it wasn't too far. 
It's tucked away off to the W. Warm Springs side of Alberton's...walking in I instantly did not like it. INSTANTLY. It is a small establishment so the minute we walked in we had to walk around a large group that was seated right in front of the door...who does that? I can barely hear any of the ladies greeting us and my husband sure as hell didn't hear them tell us we can sit anywhere we'd like because we stood in front of the register like dummies. Well hello to y'all too!  

When we finally figured out we could seat ourselves one of the ladies came over and handed us the menu...she was bleh as a server so whatever. But enough but about her. We opened the menu and I know my husband was thrown off by the PRICES!!! His statement, ""Soooo...this place is more expensive than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. It better blow my fucking mind!"" 

We wanted to use the Yelp check-in offer for 50% off of a 2nd dinner when you buy a dinner. So we chose something off of the ""Dinner"" section of the menu. We ordered 2 fountain drinks at $2.89 each! (Fucking expensive for a fountain drink that comes filled with nothing but ice even if the damn refills are free)...2 orders of chicken and waffles priced at $11.25 each, which we thought was a fair price for ""dinner"". 
We were first served the cornbread cake...which was good but nothing special...you can get this (same flavor and all) from any soul food restaurant. Then the OWNER brings me my food which I thought was nice. So I got 3 pieces of chicken on one large plate with swirls of grease decorating the plate here and there and a separate plate for the waffle and syrup. 

I. Was. NOT. Impressed. 

The presentation of the food didn't even look appetizing and the portions are ridiculously small!!! I sucked it up and didn't want to complain to my husband since he was so hyped about this place. He gets his 3 pieces of chicken on a large plate and we wait for his waffle. I'm not a rude-ass and would never eat if the rest of my party hadn't gotten their food...so we BOTH wait. It took them a few minutes to realize we weren't eating and why we weren't eating and finally one of the waitresses saw and went back to grab his waffle. Thanks. 

I nibbled on the chicken first and realized it tasted exactly like the seasoning that come in the Wai Wai MaMa noodles packages I get from the Asian store. Smh. It was ok...I was just expecting so much more. The waffle was toooooo soft. It just wasn't right. It wasn't a waffle. But the syrup for the waffle was tastey so it kinda made up for the texture of the waffle. 

So we finish eating and get the bill...it came out to $30.57. I asked if we can use the Yelp offer for the dinner...they said NO...""because we didn't order dinner."" Well that's mighty strange, given that the meal we ordered was listed under the ""Dinner"" section in the menu. 

I didn't want to cause a scene...we just decided to never return...and I mean never...not even for a second chance. Hubs didn't want to leave a tip...but I asked him to leave an $8 for the server that helped us the 2nd time around at least...She was very attentive and polite. So that one star is for her and only her.

Here's the breakdown:
Southern Ambience: 0
Food presentation: 0
Flavor: 2 (and that's for the cornbread cake)
Food Portion: -2 
Cost: -2
Southern Hospitality: 1 (for the 2nd waitress)
Crowd: -10 For that rude-ass lady cackling next to us. (But the restaurant has nothing to do with that) 
All around score: JUST GO SOME PLACE ELSE. 

***SIDE NOTE: No Roscoe's out here but Hash House A Go Go has a great chicken and waffle plate...yes it's expensive also...no it's not a soul food restaurant... but at least the portions are GINORMOUS, FLAVORFUL and worth every single penny.***

PS...I wonder if the owner has someone else review and edit her responses before posting them to Yelpers...these responses that I have read so far come across very rude, entitled and always unapologetic... you should work on that and all the above...just my opinion.",10,_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ

Like, literally my plate was full after I looked at just 1/4 of the food (not including the desserts).  Some of my favorites were the sweet potato tater tots, chips and guacamole, mashed potatoes and gravy and baked beans.  They had really cool stations that I had never seen at another buffet before, such as artisanal cheese.  I would definitely come back because the food was good and there were a TON of options so if you have a party that has picky eaters, they will likely find something up their alley.

The hostess who sat us was also very nice.  When she found out that my sister had been to the buffet before and recommended that I come, she thanked my sister for returning and suggesting I visit.  They have to know that word of mouth marketing is really strong and you can tell that everyone takes their jobs very seriously.  They had more staff on hand (cleaning tables, setting tables, serving, preparing food) than any other buffet.  They are obviously spending a lot of wages, but the quality of that really comes through.  I even asked someone at the dessert station about desserts without nuts and she didn't know she she checked with someone instead of just guessing (as happened to me at other buffets).  That follow up, even if simple, goes a long way with me.

With that being said, the price was ridiculous.  it was $75 for two of us for lunch.  I know they have to charge that much because of the seafood and sushi, but as a girl with simple tastes, my dinner probably only cost them a couple dollars to make, at most.  Considering how shitty all the other buffets were, though, I would gladly spend more to be able to eat here.",2,KVYJN6dR6NBo8FoPpJVN6w

I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!",1,tEZLN3gP0jwfP2ugFyuuMQ

We love hooters and were very excited when we learned of the opening of this spring valley location.  Went soon after they opened and were very disappointed in everything.  Wrote to corporate, they sent gift cards.  The GM called us and apologized and invited us to come back in. We took him up on his offer and gave them another try.  When we got there we introduced ourselves to the GM and he made sure all was taken care of.  Everything was great!  Went back again another time, did not introduce ourselves and once again bad food and service.

I really like Dr. Imas.  Always makes sure you have the time you need to go over everything without feeling rushed.  What I don't like is the front staff.  Although they are nice and helpful, everytime I have to call it goes to voicemail/message system where more than half the time I don't get a call back and had to physically go into the office to reschedule my appointment or pick up a lost script instead of them being able to call it into the pharmacy.  
I have even brought this up to the ladies at the front desk asking if they ever do answer the phone where a weired sistutation happened.  
Me: do you guys ever answer the phone up here?
Front desk: All the time... hold on I need to get this. (No ring what's so ever unless the volume as down but there was no flashing light to even show the phone was rining) answers phone, can you please hold? (Now phoneline is flashing on hold)
She continues with me and when done she never goes back to the phone.  Meanwhile that little light was flashing and still flashing 15 min later when I was walked back.  My personal conclusion is that there was never anyone on that line and said line is not on hold directing all other calls to voicemail/message ststem......
I'm not the only one that is having the same problem with unanswered call and not returning messages. While waiting in the office today another lady was having the same problem where she had left two items behind and was trying to call the office to see if she had left them there.  She was upset when she brought this to the attention to the lady at the front.

My husband and I came here expecting a decent hotel with a great view (we paid for an upgraded room and then paid additional for a view of the strip). $150/nt (after tax/resort fee) on a Thursday on the Vegas strip for a hotel of this quality was apparently way too much. 

Good: The person checking us in was friendly and helpful with questions we had about the area. The location was really special. The theme inside the hotel common areas was adorable and was a great thing for us to see. Check-out was super fast, dropped our keys in a box by the elevator. WiFi was good/fast. We only stayed there one night so it didn't manage to ruin our whole vacation.

Bad: Price for the quality (way too much $). Paying extra got us nothing extra. Our ""view"" was of the rooftop of the lower floors and the roller coaster which was plenty loud (luckily it closed at 11pm, but still really obstructed the view we paid for). Our ""upgraded/recently updated"" room got us nothing : no coffee maker, no fridge, wallpaper peeling off of the walls. And okay, ignore all that an I just want a clean place to rest my head. But this was not that either. Didn't take showers because I saw a few curly black hairs lingering in our tub so good call there. Couldn't walk around the room without socks on (I guess that's pretty typical in a hotel) but I was even a little uncomfortable taking off my shoes. Do you ever vacuum/shampoo this carpet? 

This place was so sad and old. I had such a great first impression but I guess I shouldn't have let that fool me. Next time we won't be staying on the strip for fear that the experience will be like this again. Gosh I hope the real New York isn't so bad....",0,gNFSZPwB6P-1CeoQ6E9gXw

On my first visit I had the fish tacos - well one fish and one shrimp.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to try one of each.  They were good.  I would order them again.

The five stars come from my second visit.  I had the shrimp and steak salad.  They cook the steak perfectly to medium, as requested and the salad is simply phenomenal!   Their sun-dried tomato vinaigrette is delicious and was the perfect match.  If you have to eat a healthy salad, this is the one to pick.  The meat is spicy, tender and char-grilled.  

If you go to La Paz with expectations of their former self you might be disappointed.  I think they did a great job.  New look, new menu....just the name remains.  Plus, their house wine is one of my favorites.  How can that be bad?",1,V-vHgpadQSrsRE4ReGhEPQ

There is absolutely no decor, and the space is largely empty.  BUT, they seem to be brand-new so I am hesitant to subtract any points as I'm sure they are aware the interior still needs to be spruced.

The food, however, is amazing.  My wife had a classic burger and I had the bulgogi burger and both were absolutely on-point.  You can easily pay much more for a ""gourmet"" burger that is not nearly as flavorful or well prepared as what this little hole-in-the-wall is making.

Nicole Fukuzawa stated it was my responsibility to get a warranty. I have been with AT&T since 2007 and they have always been helpful as I've spent a lot of money on service and accessories. I would highly recommend it if you want good service that you go to another store. I called AT&T when I got home and they were kind enough to give me a $35 credit (although money was not my issue) and assured me that they will be contacting the area manager.

This was my very first purchase on my own as a 24-year-old woman. My family has purchased multiple cars via him. He is the best dealer at this Hyundai location and really goes above and beyond for his customers. Unfortunately, the customer service provided by his fellow peers do not match his. Hopefully, the story below will defer first time buyers like me away from a bad dealership with terrible customer service. 

7/31 Took a hiking trip and made it back home safely when this brand-new car under 7,000 miles battery died. This was odd for me because it is a brand-new car so I didn't understand why the car just died. All my key fobs were not working and no power to the entire car. At this point I was fine because I knew it would be fixed under the warranty. Called Antonio to let him know what was going on, he advised me that I had roadside assistance for 5 years so I called to get the battery jumped, and it didn't work so Antonio asked me to bring the car to the dealership. After arriving there I was immediately greeted (if that's what you call it) with distasteful customer service. A service clerk named Linda chastised me and the representative from the towing company with a negative tone basically asking why we were there and blocking her service area instead of directing us where we needed to go, saw that we were being serviced already and passed us off in an extremely rude manner. Mind you I later saw her help three other customers with the exact opposite kind of attitude, so it's not like she was having a bad day, I'm assuming we were just a problem for her. My normal service representative was busy so I was passed off to another rep to assist in getting a courtesy car. I had to go to get the car myself, and also received it with no gas, after telling the rep three times, he then had it filled. No one asked if I needed help with anything else, or told me when I should be expecting my vehicle, NO ONE ASKED ME FOR THE KEY TO MY CAR AT A CAR DEALERSHIP, and my problems seemed to be an inconvenience to every and anyone at the dealership.

8/2 Went to pick-up the vehicle and showed up with no one inside the facility. After searching, I found the General Manager of the branch who proceeded to walk me to the service area to get my vehicle, I knew he had heard of my experience previously, so out of knowledge of ""good"" customer service, I expected him to ask what happened, but he seemed to show no interest in it. After receiving my vehicle, I told the manager I wouldn't be returning, and all I got was an uninterested ""Sad to hear it,"" and I drove off of the lot. I'm usually not the type to speak on bad service but previously, I've recommended this place to many family members and friends, so I'm doing this in hopes that no one will have to deal with this kind of service again.",5,hThXXWAByYfKIEgKQr7L0A

We ordered a small bowl of traditional guacamole which was delicious and fresh and enjoyed the unique mixture of root vegetable (as well as tortilla) chips. On the recommendation of our charming waiter, I think his name was Amin, I ordered the Slow Smoke Pulled Chicken. It was Excellent. It was moist tender pulled apart chicken over a yellow saffron rice (with small amounts of chopped white onion and thin jalape√±o slices) and chubby slices of fried and caramelized plantains on the side.

The cappuccinos are done well, small cups, not too much foam, etc., with excellent flavor. Their baked goods are very good, for the small selection they tend to have. They are a bit on the pricey side though, but maybe that's just Calgary. It can get very busy, very quickly and there isn't a lot of seating, especially when it's cold out. The space layout is a little wonky too, but it seems to be good for socializing.

It does have the best cappuccino that I have ever had. Perfect size and flavor, and the pastries are good. There's a reason it's so popular.

What blows me away about the place though, is how popular it is. What I mean is, where are all the people coming from? For 40 years that little strip mall was dead, nothing really stuck, except for the small convenient store.

Arrived in the morning and paid $295 deductible for the planned 2-day stay in the hospital. I was told that Banner Estrella requires an overnight stay for this surgical procedure. After surgery and recovery I was assigned a room on orthopedic floor (6th floor). PT personnel came to my room and conducted an extensive therapy session.  I had dinner served to me in the assigned room that evening.  I told my surgeon that I felt really good and asked if he would discharge me.  He had the nurse make sure I had meds from the hospital pharmacy and I was discharged that evening.

Six months later I received a bill from Banner Estrella Med. Ctr. for $1,684. After numerous calls to my insurance company and Banner, I was told by Banner that the $1,684 charge was due to the procedure being classified by them as an ""outpatient procedure"".  A procedure, I might add that cost a total of $71,565.  Had I stayed overnight like I was scheduled, there would have been no charge - doesn't quite make sense - does it.  If it was going to cost be $1,684 to have my doctor discharge me early - shouldn't someone from the hospital have told me that. Given the option of paying $1,685 to go home that evening or stay overnight and pay nothing - I certainly would have stayed overnight.

After numerous attempts to get their billing people to review my situation I was told it was turned over to Patient Relations and that I would be contacted in a few days regarding the matter.  I have not been contacted and on July 6th I received another copy of the statement indicating that I owe $1,685.  Still no resolution.",0,Vzf7XT0mNX1VKqkBMYRPFg

I'm part of the promotional team behind a custom knife show that happens every Labor Day Weekend at this hotel. PH had been so good to us over the years that I decided to stay here while I was in Vegas for the SHOT Show and UFC Fights.

Unfortunately my last stay was not so pleasant.

I was sent an email allowing me to check in online. I clicked the link and was told I would receive a text when I checked in. I got it before I boarded the plane. Pretty cool, huh?

Wait it gets worse.

The email told me to go to the ""Key Desk"" to pick up my keys. I disembarked the airport shuttle with some other people and went to the Key Desk. The desk jockey was talking to some idiot couple who were checking in like they were at the Registration Desk. I thought this was supposed to be an express check-in deal? Whatever.

Twenty five minutes later the people who rode with me were happily walking to their rooms while I was still waiting for this moron to tell these assholes from Iowa how to flush a toilet.

When he finally got to me, I was done in less than 3 minutes. As I walked away he called over the next person in line from registration. I shook my head in disgust wondering why they would have someone like this manning the express ""Key Desk"".

The weekend was over, I received my bill. These assholes charged me $22.40 for this ""convenience"" and refused to reverse the charges.

Of the cakes I tried last night, the Red Velvet was the worst - it was really dry and tasteless. The Sweet Tea was slightly dry but had excellent flavor.  The Hummingbird was the best of the night - it definitely was the most flavorful and moist of those that I tried. 

I would definitley like to check out the shop though & get a fresh cupcake.  And I do look forward to watching the Cupcake Wars episode that they won on the Food Network.  (It will run again on Tues Sept 20.)",0,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA

In a way, you're always left unsatisfied after you dig in to these tasty treats, simply because you yearn for more. And yearn I did! I've been frequenting this place for the past two years or so. It is relatively close by to campus, and is definitely on the route to my house, so if it's 100+ degrees and you're experiencing a craving for a flavorful treat, what better place is there other than Little India? 

Honestly, I haven't had a myriad of foods here. When I like something, I'm quite obstinate, and I stick to it. However, I have tasted bhel puri at five or so other Indian ""chaat"" places peppered around the valley, and nothing can compare to the bhel puri in Little India! Anyway, instead of yelping about it, I'm going to shut off my laptop, leave campus in an hour or so, and then go to Little India because I'm hungry.",8,HxTg2mFLBkrKmnE4tK0wSg

The beer selection is awesome. For the most part, the service is on point. I've had a couple of instances where I was a little annoyed though.

One such instance is when I went through the drive thru... I pull up and ask the guy for a 4 pack of Boddingtons. He shrugs his shoulders, gives me a snotty look and asks ""what's that?"" I reply ""...it's beer, dude"" while trying to contain my laughter. I didn't think I was making such an outlandish request. And i know this guy has been working here for awhile. I see him here all the time. He says back ""ok...where is it?"" At this point I'm wondering if he's just having a shitty day or he just took a huge bong rip in the back. I tell him ""in the beer cooler, about 4 or 5 doors from the left. Top shelf. Tall yellow cans."" In my head I'm thinking ""jeez dude, want me to ring myself up too?"" He goes back, is gone for about 3 minutes, and comes back with it finally. I pay and pull away. No ""Thank You"" or anything. Sorry if I was insulting your intelligence, but you seriously don't know where your own product is located? Does someone else tie your shoes for you before you leave for work? It's not like I was asking for some obscure,  triple hopped chocolate milk stout pale ale from Iran. It's Boddingtons! 
 
Another time I went in, I was followed around the store by an employee,  literally hawk - eyeing me as I was looking through their whiskey selection. I guess anyone with tattoos and a shaved head is a thief that needs to be spied on. Don't let the looks fool you, I'm not a gang member or an ex con. I'm just an honest alcoholic. 

The blonde ladies that work there need to take a Xanax and chill the f out too. I get it- you probably deal with trashy dudes all day. It's a liquor store in shitty mesa. But if I make eye contact, smile and say hello to you and you don't say hi back, now YOU'RE the trash. Just sayin.

The buffet was good and reasonably priced.

My biggest gripe with this hotel (and the reason I only gave it 2 stars) is the extreme incompetence of the woman at the front desk. When I tried to check my father in law and my sister in law in to their room, the person at the desk couldn't find their reservation because she was looking for it using my father in law's FIRST name instead of his last name.

Reminiscent of Bloor's Toronto Reference Library in design, I'd say NYCL is the cozy younger sibling. Also, unlike the Reference Library, a lot more of the books are actually for circulation. Each floor is divided according to field of interest, with whole stacks devoted solely to business, and another level to science. The very top floor is also worth a gander with its impressive collection of microfilms. If you're looking to study, I can vouch for the pin-drop noise level of the upper floors. Plenty of natural lighting and seating, as well as power outlets. The occasional coat trees dotting the perimeter were well made use of during my February visit. 

Super convenient location for those commuting by TTC as it is in the same complex as North York Center Station. There is also a bustling food court if reading makes you peckish (I know it make me...but then again, I'm always up for a bite) and I believe food is allowed in the library's bottom floor study hall.

Where do I even start..
We got into a fender bender on July 4th weekend (I'm sure we weren't the only ones) we called the towing company and was referred to Excel Auto Body so instead of taking the car home we decided to take it in to their shop. 
The shop was closed so the owner decided to meet us there to leave the car over the weekend, my first question was how much? (as everyone's should be!) he gave us the run arounds and told us we'd hear from them on Monday, 
We didn't get a phone call til Tuesday! Then the secretary kept making excuses on why it was no longer a 'free estimate', charged us for a teardown (when I didn't consent to taking the car apart), and making it sound like my car was in bad shape even though she didn't know jack shet about what needed to be done! 
More insulting, one of their shop guys offered me 1000 to get it off my hands! Knowing well enough that the cost to repair was NOT $5200 worth! (I should add my boyfriend KNOWS And WORKS on cars!)
My opinion, they tried to jack up cost of repairs so they could make it seem like it wasn't worth it so id be willing to sell it to their employee.
I was furious! And my reviews aren't stopping here!
On the plus, we took the car to ABC Auto Body and they paid for the towing cost and told us they don't even know how Excel quoted us at $5200 when it was only a $2500 repair!!

Just about as dumb as you can get.

Edit after the response of the restaurant's manager:

First, it is good to know that management is reading these reviews (and responding). I hope it makes for a better experience for diners.

It is difficult, at best, to figure out how closing the windows on a nice day solves a problem with the air conditioning. Speaking without hyperbole, it was at least as nice outside the restaurant as it was inside.

And sitting on the other side of the bar, which was open, is a magnificent idea. Too bad that we were first told that ""it wasn't open yet"" and the hostess offered to let us know when it was while we waited at the bar, which we did. Eventually, we gave up and moved to a table so we could eat after again being told it wasn't open. Minutes later, we watched dozens of people move to the cool, comfortable and enjoyable side of the restaurant while we waited for our food. No hostess or wait staff offered to help us move. We were certainly past the point of caring by then.

My first visit to Blue Adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from San Francisco with my ladyfriend Tassie and two drugged-out cats that somehow managed to howl most of  the way down.  We were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to Sun Valley about three years prior.  I was a little worried when I saw the establishments Howard-Johnson's style exterior, but all fears evaporated when we entered what I consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining environment, and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness. 

The menu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious San Francisco-style creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what you'll be served. To the contrary...the menu did a great job of describing traditional Mexican fare, skillfully presenting additional nuances that came across as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.

The food was great...tasty, and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else I've had in the Mesa area.  Skillful presentation, creative seasonings, and the absence of excessive fat were among it's strong points.

We went here twice, and both times we sung it's praises.  But Tassie returned here with her relatives one day, and not all went well.  The staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infant/toddler.  It took eons to get a high-chair, and from that point on the level of service went from warm-and-fuzzy to cold-and-distant.

 I'm paying NO monthly fees to anyone.  I Installed on Thursday, and Friday a friend wanted to come over for some scotch and talk about his Dad's impending Big Exit - so I went to the system and looked at the on-screen program guide, and it said ""Watch this program or Record this program"" - clicked one button and walked away and everything worked out fine - excellent quality picture and really simple, intuitive commands and remote control system.
I am a HUGE fan - will post more later as I find out all the qualities of the system.
Oh BTW - the customer service is EXCELLENT - I asked how to delete the preachers and Spanish-language channels and got a response same day with simple instructions - much easier to channel surf now.",1,fJQh95jx1v8AulFxS1TKFQ

We spent a lot of time on an incomplete puzzle, an error that would be immediately noticeable when putting the room back to normal. Somehow the camera also didn't alert the staff that help was needed.

Another part of the room was broken, without prior notice, so an assistant had to enter the room to give us a puzzle piece. Shutting down the room until this could be repaired would be a better option than grinding out money from a faulty room. Lastly, the final section of the room was blazing hot.

I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place. 

The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more.",5,v6J_GeMsl6XTT-ZsV6ApHA

What made me sad: no salad dressing, mint chutney served in shitty little plastic takeout containers though we ate in. No red wine. 

On a Friday albeit early the place was empty. Seriously just the two of us in a 75 seater. Salad iceberg with basics no dressing. 

Paneer something or other was spicy with 6 paneer

Beef Khury 2 chunks but really super tender. But 2 chunks. 

Rice old oily and cumin seeds fell to the bottom. Paneer and Khury don't come with rice

In fact, I've experienced the opposite: what I order is what I get and the staff is friendly and efficient. I've been especially impressed by the manager on duty on weekday mornings - he seems to keep things moving and pitches in wherever he's needed. 

I experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd ""get it done."" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc. 

Anyway, it's possible management has changed since a lot of these reviews because my experiences have really been pretty positive. 

P.S. Try the asparagus egg breakfast sandwich on the thin wheat bagel. It's a great vegetarian option. Just ask for light sauce.",2,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ

We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead.

Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.

The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.

Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.

The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.

I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.

We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.

I was prepared to pay a bit more for a higher quality frame. As I was looking through the huge selection of styles,the salesperson came to me and mentioned that the owner overheard my situation and was willing to help me out, seeing as though my financial situation was strained. Even though I was preparing to make a $200 purchase the owner was willing to give me a demo frame of a different color, but identical style to the ones I had originally and at no cost. To me, this speaks volumes about the type of business they are running and the people they employ. I originally went here on a 2 for 1 deal and got two pair with prescription for around $300.

I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here.  I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair.  THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage.  Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy,  My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves.  Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream.  THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant.  She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service.  THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking,  Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there,  One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced,  Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices.",1,LvDh4IoBHdtojqZI1G3vrg

From the very beginning, Carrie was so extremely sweet and helpful. I had my eye on a particular dress, which she just so happened to have! It was kismet. She answered my initial questions quickly and kindly via email and setting up an appointment was swift and painless. When I walked into the store with my mother, aunt, and two bridesmaids, Carrie greeted us with a giant smile and the warmest of welcomes. 

She and her staff really make you feel like you're the only bride in the world. The attention to detail is fantastic. What I especially appreciated about Carrie is that she is open and honest with her opinions when it comes to dresses that ""work"" for you. It's obvious that she won't try to sell you on something that's not a 100% perfect fit just for the sake of making a sale. As I was going through the racks to make my initial selections, I pulled a dress that was 3x my budget and she told me right away, before I even tried it on. I thought that was so great! You can tell that she's passionate about her job and that made the experience that much better. Plus, she's got a background in fashion so she's really an expert.

My dress came in early and I was actually out of town when it was delivered. Mariee kindly held on to my dress while I was gone that week and when I went to pick it up it was again such a smooth process. The dress was perfect. I was so in love!

Mariee is a fantastic locally owned bridal store. Definitely check them out!",0,y_80HAikhByqCD6WdWKr8Q

I went in to ask for my money back, they charged me for the same service twice (which was never provided).  Practically the first words out of the owner were, ""call 911.""  Yea....I was overcharged, asked for my money back, and have been being harassed from this company ever since!  They are claiming that I am lying about how many times I have even been there!  When in fact, their own stylists are lying about how many times they have done=screwed up my hair and are reporting it differently (OR NOT AT ALL) in their computers!  The first stylist I saw there was LENA=bad haircut!  I came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had, which is what I had requested initially but they decided to give me Lena, with only 3 yrs experience.  After most experienced Sarah had fixed my haircut, I decided to let Sarah do another cut and also dye my hair.  BAD CHOICE!  I would have never had SARAH do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like I requested they insisted on fixing it!  And, she did so again the 2nd time, and again the 3rd time!  She is the teacher there, so this is why I allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since Sarah is the teacher there I figured I was getting the best they had to offer...YIKES!!!  I am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this salon...I take responsibility for being the idiot (I'M TOO NICE!) for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like I requested the first, second, and third times.  BUT NOW, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR!  THEY ARE STEALING MY $210, NEVER PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY HAVE NOW CHARGED ME TWICE FOR AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH LAWSUITS AND WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY CALLING 911 FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN UGLY BUSINESS PRACTICES!  SECRETS HAIR SALON IS HORRIBLLE!!!!!!  I actually have it all written down in my calendar (& on my head:() (however, not one of these ""women"" will even listen to or try to help me-instead they just called 911!  The manager, Luann, (with the full support of her owner=evil!) threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because I left a comment on Facebook so others will know that these ""women"" will NOT only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward, they are threatening your civil rights!!!!!  Freedom of speech, honesty, & integrity do not even exist in this salon!  And, they actually did call the cops on me and I had to talk to 2 cops when I showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says I have only seen Sarah 2 times!  When I have in reality seen her 4 times!!!!!!!!!!! 1 fix haircut after LENA originally screwed it up + 3 bad haircuts/dye jobs!  HERE R THE DATES: 2/12: bad haircut and dye job (from SARAH), 2/19 SARAH was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from SARAH, 4/12 SARAH was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut & dye job from SARAH!  Of course I was charged the $100 ($65 dye + $35 cut) the first time Sarah did cut and dye (2/12), BUT for some reason she charged me another $110 (dye + cut + $10 gloss) on 4/12, but that was supposed to FIX the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times!  NOW, THE TOP HALF OF MY HEAD IS BRASSY ORANGE WITH BRIGHT NEON YELLOW PATCHES/HIGHLIGHTS :( & THE REST OF MY HAIR IS AN UGLY ORANGE BROWN :(:(:(  I USED TO RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERYWHERE I WENT UNTIL I STARTED COMING TO THIS SALON, NOW EVERYONE I SEE SAYS ""IT'S NOT TOOOO BAD:(""  I have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at Great Clips & Wal-Mart!!!!  Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And your sanity!  They leave voicemails on my phone 10 times in a row after 7 pm, harass me, threaten me, call the cops on me, try to have me arrested for trespassing when I show up to their business both to explain how they are mistaken and for proof of the fallacies they are spuing, but they all just want to be THIEVING LIARS and not help anyone but themselves :(  Secrets Hair Salon is BOTCHED!!!!!!!!!!!",1,QyCuMMY6eYmo5xq4b3T3FQ

VZOlFKHD6PEQVv9aDs1u_w,0,2014-04-01,0,AVD020pRBn1Ubnrk-A3WPw,"Stopped in once to ask about my laptop battery not charging (I had read Dell Diagnostics and support threads, but wanted to take it in first before I got into buying parts). The visit was probably 10 minutes and the guy at the counter literally just turned the computer on to see the ""not charging"" message, turned it off and directed me to Batteries Plus. Needless to say I was a bit surprised, but I thought maybe he was trying to save me some money. 

So off to Batteries Plus I go, where the only battery they had in stock wasn't a complete match and did not work on my system. They offered to order me a replacement battery for $170, but I figured I could get a better deal online. So I ordered a replacement battery and AC adapter just in case. Both come and I try them with no success. My computer won't recognize the new battery. While testing all this I realized that there was a BIOS update I needed, but wouldn't run because my Dell battery didn't have enough charge and the replacement battery wasn't recognized. 

So I went back to Data Doctors with all the parts and explanation of what I had found. I suppose I should have turned around as soon as they couldn't take my credit card info because their router was down (not good for an IT/computer company to have IT issues). For some reason they asked to keep the replacement AC adapter, but not the replacement battery only to call me 2 days later and ask for the battery (never mind that their hours mean I am late to work if I have to stop by). So by Friday afternoon, after having my computer for 5 days, I called to check on it because 5 days seemed like an awful long time to have my laptop. They told me almost word for word what I told them was the problem on Day 1. The diagnosis was that I needed a Dell battery and not a generic replacement. It took them 5 days to tell me that. 

They also told me they had discovered some Trojan viruses on my computer. I was skeptical since I have been shelling out money to McAfee for years. So when I got my computer back I ran a scan, which came back negative, but when looking at the scanning history, I was reminded that McAfee did find 4 viruses 2 YEARS AGO and had quarantined them.

I am glad I got my laptop back when I did and am sorry I didn't ask for a refund because the only thing Data Doctors did for me was prevent me from having a usable laptop for a week. I certainly don't need them to order me a Dell battery, when I can do that myself. I was under the mistaken idea that a computer repair company would have spare parts to test systems so that I could have diagnosed the issue before having to go out an replace parts one by one. I should have called my company's IT department back in Virginia because they would have been more helpful.

I can't speak to other locations, but I will never patronize the Ahwatukee store again. I did ultimately resolve the problem when I found PHX CPU. Since I had pretty much done all my own diagnostics, I realized it was either the DC power jack or motherboard. Thankfully, it was the former and PHX CPU replaced my power jack and my laptop is running perfectly again.",3,kVVwLexO6MwRzaJRP8w_sw

I always figure maybe the employee was having a bad day. Not in this case. I've been twice. I'm pretty sure it was the owner who did my nails both times. The first time she rushed and did not listen and filed my nails down to the skin. I let it go and paid. I went back thinking hey maybe this time will be better. Nope. Same lady. Told me the wait was 15-20 minutes. No big deal I had a phone call to make. About five minutes go by, and I'm about to hang up when she basically gets in my face and tells me it's time. Not hearing the other person on the line anymore because of the employee in my space, I had to hang up. Not a big deal, I got my phone call done. I pick my color and sit down.  I tell her DO NOT take off length. (I'm pretty proud of my nails and length at this point). She doesn't even acknowledge. She's looking around while filing. And before I know it my nails are stubs. She goes in for the massage, way tooooo rough, I legit thought she dislocated one of my fingers. So I tell her no fancy stuff, just please finish the manicure. She then insults me and tells me I should have told her I didn't want a massage. Well I didn't realize I would be in pain or else I would of told her. She legit puts two coats of the polish on, gets up and tells me I'm done. No top coat, no finishing. Nothing. As my chipped nails were drying I was watching her on another client who was also making faces, I can only assume from the pain. This lady was very rude. Rushed, and did not pay attention or listen.

Unbeknown to most, there is another security checkpoint upstairs that is always faster than the one on the ground level. The tram that takes you from security to the terminals is quick. Gate agents and other employees are nice enough, although I have not often had to deal with them because flights are on time (with American). 

There are good food options in the small food court so you should be able to find what you need for a quick meal. If you want a sit down restaurant there are those as well. For cocktails, there is Martini's, which I have been to a couple of times--they also serve food.

Every week things are rearranged again, and staples like whole wheat bread are often hard to find. Used to get at least two loaves a week, now half the time they don't have it - just dessert-y breads with fruit in them or whatever.  And if you ask for it sliced, sometimes they slice it properly, sometimes in giant thick slabs. Feh. But now they've got a hot table, and a salad bar, and a breakfast special, and... basically so many things they don't have time to concentrate on baking. It's a shame because this place was such a great standby before! Hoping the new management recover their senses and get things back on track.

When we didn't print it out because it was not on our voucher to print the coupon out the manager on duty Vanessa refused to honor the coupon. She even noticed that it did not state print on our coupon and still didn't honor it. That honestly has been the worse service I have ever received at a wingstop.

The first time I went to this salon was for keratin smoothing treatment and color. After four hours at the salon, I went home and my grey roots were still showing. I had to return and have my hair ""fixed."" Assuming this was an isolated experience(apparently I had not read the reviews on this and other sites), I decided to go back and try Salon M2 again. My appointment was for the kerasilk smoothing treatment and color. The keratin was done incorrectly and my hair turned orange!!! The stylist saw how upset I was and promised to fix my hair within the next two days because I had two events to attend. For that reason, I paid, under the guise that my hair would be fixed. I called the following day (3x) and was told the manager would call me back. She never did. The next day, a Saturday, I tried again and no one even answered the phone. Being that no one called me back and were clearly dodging my calls, I disputed the charge on my credit card. A month later, I received a phone call from the owner, Michele, asking why I disputed the charge.

By the time I got back to work with the correct order I had 5 whole minutes to sit down and eat. It was awful. The egg part was warm but the hamburger part was cold. Probably because they just crumbled up the cheeseburger from the wrong order and added it to the egg omelette. Disgusting. I should have known it was going to be disappointing.

This Pei Wei is by my work and the first time I went there with coworkers everyone else got their food and my food didn't come. Finally I asked what had happened to my food and the person said that they made it with chicken instead of shrimp, but they never asked me what I would like to do. They just assumed I would rather wait than eat a different protein, but it was a work lunch hour, so not the choice I would have made.

Today I needed to run an errand at lunch right by the Pei Wei. I went early so I could order and pay before the rush but wanted it ready to pick up in 20 minutes. After three people tried to delay the order, the store manage said they couldn't do it and I would just have to come back and place the order then. 

I knew it would. E too long of a line then and not enough time and I was incredulous that this was his suggestion and asked what they do when someone calls in an order and he said they can do it then. So I said that if I were calling they could do it but since I was standing in front of them, they couldn't. He agreed and said I could either call or come in later. I told him I would just go somewhere else. He seemed annoyed and reiterated that his computer wouldn't let him do it. 

If it were me, I would have taken the order and money and just told my cook line to not make that order and then in 15 minutes tell them to make it. It's not that difficult when you make customer service the priority.",3,aXuADtwWImTx87Sl4kK68A

He asked me how I had heard of Wren House, and I explained that I had seen their beers around the area at places such as Sip and The Pig's Meow. 

I love clean, fresh IPAs. Their wren house IPA is fantastic. They reminds me of the Green Flash beers - strong and intense. I purchased two beers to drink there and a baby growler to go for $20.00. Not bad! 

They do not have food at this time but I was informed that something is in the works for bringing in a food company / small bites. I think an olive/nuts/cheese board would be the perfect accompaniment to their beers. Never fear though, they've got chips and pork rinds!

Seeing that Sakana was a popular choice with 4 stars, I placed my bet here hoping that it would be yummy. Dinner was $26 and since we came before 5:30PM we didn't have to wait in line. The restaurant was very cute looking with the decor but a little small.

The menu is extensive, like super big with so many choices from hand rolls to yakitori to hot rolls to nigiri to appetizer. I ordered all nigiri and was not disappointed in the fish quality and size! My favorites were the salmon belly, yellowtail, and squid. The Amai ebi (sweet shrimp) was great as well!!! The uni was bitter though and I wasn't a real fan. The only appetizer I got was the pork belly which was fatty and delicious!! 

They offered many dessert options but they weren't super amazing. Ice cream was melted and the tempura ice cream was disappointing as the tempura surrounding the ice cream part was white bread deep fried. Tiramisu was a no-no but the housemade green tea panna Cotta was great though small. 

The only big problem I had was that when I first ordered, they forgot to give me about half my orders. And so, I had to reorder that part all over again, which was pretty annoying. The servers were kind though and helpful and water was always refilled without asking.

We later return to try their Bento box. This would be the reverse of our sentiment over the stone grill thing. It appears to be gimmicky, but it is definitely not that.

My companion and I (always) order the vegetarian platter, which was $18. We asked the owner/manager if it's $18/person (a popular way Ethiopian restaurants seem to charge for their dishes) and he said it's meant to fill one person, but we may as well order 1 and see if we would be full. We were not. The platter is enough for 1.5 people(person?). The owner noticed we were not quite ""satisfied"" and when my friend asked if we could get another bowl of the sides, the owner gave it to us on the house. Now this is how you do business!! With the extra side, I had a very satisfactory and filling meal. So (you know what I'm going to say next), the service here was exceptional, including the waiter and waitress.

Food wise, the injera (which is gluten free) was very delicious in terms of flavour and texture. Also no upset stomach yay! The sides were not oily but was not as flavourful as I would have liked. Their best side in the veggie platter was probably their beets and this one side (that I cannot figure out what it is from the taste/appearance) that leaves a bitter after taste but is quite flavourful. The other sides were meh--again, not enough flavour.

Overall, food is a 3.5 (especially for the high price point), but the generosity of the owner and service from the wait staff moves them up to a 4.",3,v-R38AMN2ZZgr_iszlgc_Q

Drinks came quickly, we ordered some guac - we were off to a great start.  Then came the first lull.  When the guac was dropped off, we ordered food and my hubby ordered another margarita.  We had to waive someone down to ask for some more (full-sized) chips.  Guac was okay, nothing special.  Then we waited, and waited, and no one brought his drink.  We stopped our waitress to ask for some more salsa.  10 minutes later, our entrees came - no drink for my hubby, no salsa.  Waitress came by again, grabbed the empty salsa bowl, and I ordered another drink.  Those were all dropped off and we didn't see anyone else until we were ready to go.

The meat was cooked exactly as ordered and was DELICIOUS.  My husband is certain it's the best steak he has ever had.  In addition, he tried their VIP Martini . . . pineapple infused with Vodka - WOW!  It was the tastiest martini ever.  (So tasty, we're going to try our hand at making one at home.)

Is this really the best that a world-class city like Calgary can do?  I grew up with Taylor Field (ie. Mosaic Stadium) - it's a sad state of affairs when Saskatchewan is ahead of Alberta in the infrastructure game.  Or Edmonton for that matter when you compare Commonwealth Stadium to McMahon.

Why I dislike coming here (and this has nothing to do with the general atmosphere at a Stamps game...which are usually pretty fun):

- Limited to no parking at the stadium itself (Pro: Easy access to the C-Train), and I have no idea how one would ever get a parking or tailgating spot.  If you do drive, it is a gong show getting to or from the general area during sporting events.

- Chairs with no backs.  Seriously, it's 2013 - I'm sure we could spend a little money getting proper chairs that aren't wooden backless benches.

- Limited space in the concourses.  I went to the Stamps/Riders game this summer - it was an absolute nightmare trying to get from your seats to get drinks or to the washroom.  I can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was ever an emergency during a game.  This lack of space is especially evident at half-time, where line-ups for food and booze are very long.  Service for drinks is VERY slow!

- Washrooms - I will give them a point for at least having decent washrooms that are generally clean.

- Stairs - If you ever have the misfortune of sitting in the cheap seats amongst the riffraff that tends to frequent Stamps games, not only can you expect to leave with a sore back and bum, but also expect to fear for your life walking up and down slippery metal stairs.

All in all, McMahon has limited redeeming features.  Time to tear it down and start over again.",2,_ee95opWLnHPT_u38BY9WQ

I have been to many a strip club with my boyfriend (hey, I like it too) including various locations of chains such as Spearmint Rhino and DeJaVu but scores takes the cake. We have been there many times and we return for a reason. Its clean, its friendly, and its not raunchy. They actually have a woman's restroom, which I appreciate. I have gotten wayyy to used to having to use the dressing room restroom and hate getting weird looks from half naked girls as I walk in on them lotioning up. Their dancers are good, hot, toned, and sexy. Every half hour or so they do a sexy Cirque De So lie style acrobat strip tease which is always fun to watch, but, the experience that puts the cherry on top was the last time we went. We decided to get a table and bottle service. We had no reservation so we were sure it wouldn't happen, but we called from the cab anyway. We were greeted at the door by ""Des"" clad in a business suit with card in hand, he shook our hand eagerly. He kindly showed us all our room options (balcony, VIP, or ""bachelor party"") and we chose VIP. The room was great! It was a glass encased room with a private bar and pole, yet still had a view of the main pole. We were seated in a comfy booth and arranged our bottle service. Our personal bartender was great! She was friendly and didn't mind making any type of drink we asked for, right at our table. A few girls came by, all very friendly. Now, you have to understand, I am a woman and I am with a man, so, the treatment we normally receive is to be completely ignored. I have actually had to get up and go ask strippers to come dance for my boyfriend because they wont approach our table. That wasn't a problem here! We instructed our bar tender to then get us ""the hottest girl here!"" and boy did she deliver. I cant go into details being this isn't an adult website, but our girl was top notch.

Quiet, chill vibe on the patio? Check. I don't know what it's like on the inside, but according to other Yelpers, there may be some bleach over-usage? Who knows. Guess I'll have to check it out on a cooler night. 

We came here for date night on a hot, summer evening and tried the scallop appetizer, the filet and a bottle of bubbly. The appetizer was good--I'm not really one for ""fruit salsas"" but they did a pretty great job with their mango variety. The scallops were wrapped in bacon, which meant they really didn't get a good sear. I like mine with the sear, but these were perfectly cooked even without it. The filets were also good, but I think I make them better at home. They had a sweeter glaze on them, which I didn't like. The potatoes weren't very good (a little meal-y/grainy) and the asparagus was just... well, asparagus. If you're going to get spendy on a cut of steak, you want it to be mind-blowing. This really wasn't, although the presentation was pretty. While properly cooked, I just didn't really like the preparation. I wish I would have asked for the ""toppings"" on the side. 

I think next time around I would stick to the snack-y side of their very large menu. There were a ton of pizza options, cheese plates and other delicious small plates.

Juicy, tender, buttery and so flavorful. 
I savored every single bite of it. 
The risotto that accompanied it was delicious...but the tenderloin was definitely the star. It was quite a hefty piece of meat too; they definitely were not cheap with it. 

The ambience is great; cozy, unpretentious and just like a French bistro. We had a great wine that went with our meal...french...can't remember the grape...something i've never heard of (fer...?)

I understand that lots of people have their great reviews of this place it would appear that my children have had the exact order experience.  It would appear that if your child has any issue that might be deemed as ""complex"" you are almost guaranteed to have a bad experience here.

My youngest child has all of their specialists @ PCH.  Which in and of it's is not an issue as they have satellite offices... if you need a procedure done... it's a 45 minute drive to central phx.  Then the drama starts... 

apparently if you have another child you are expected to leave them somewhere or leave your sick child unattended... WTF!   Sorry that's not going to happen. But it would seem that many parents do this as this is their ""policy"".  

Next is their issue of wanting a copy of your drivers license to visit-yeah not happening so you are required to sign in-no problem there- just put down any name and room (they don't actually check) this is just to give you the ""feeling"" of security for your child--they aren't actually going to put a monitor on your child and if you child is mobile and walks out of the hospital on their own they aren't actually going to say anything but there is the feeling of safety

Parking is also awesome (that is sarcasm).  I have had their mall cops leave no less than 6 notes on my vehicle for parking ""violations"" interesting that my vehicle was singled out... perhaps it is the pro LE/military/fire decals they didn't like because my violation was parking in a spot backwards(something I observed other doing with no notes)

Now we are on to their nurses-- if you have not spent the better part of your adult life working in the medical field with some of the worlds best healthcare workers I can understand how you would this ""wow this place is so good"".  If you are like my family we know better-- I have had to manage my child's emergency medical needs on the PICU more times that I can count--- when my child stops breathing I have had nurses turn and walk out of the room as I am applying oxygen and doing CPR on my child- YES in the ICU the nurse had no idea what to do.  

Additionally there is the issue of none of the doctors will ever actually talk to each other.  Everything is done through someone else- while this might be ok on a limited basis general Dr vs surgeon for a badly broken arm--- if you have more than 3 specialists it will take DAYS for a discharge order- yep my ins got billed for 3 extra days of an ICU stay because they couldn't decide what to do with us. 

And then there is the billing--- I get it times are tough and a hospital needs to keep the lights on (pay for all of the fancy bronze statues) I have 2 separate ins policies for my family I asked for an itemized bill--- they billed me for medication that I provided(child has special restrictions they are unable to meet @ their pharmacy).  But they billed me for the Med as if they had supplied it (hello ins fraud).  When called out on this issue they acted as if it was just a small clerical error- yeah if I was paying cash this would have been a huge issue.  


TL;DR
If you have another option go somewhere else anywhere else.  I'm sure at one time this place earned their reputation but don't believe the hype!",2,Q3HtMEFR0VowummEtyUDHQ

We tried to be as quiet as possible but it wasn't good enough for the people in the room next to us and they called hotel security with a noise complaint. Hotel security came up to our room to tell us that we were disturbing the people in the room next to us . When hotel security arrived to ""reprimand "" us the person next door to us opened their room door to complain about how loud we were being but made sure to stay inside their room so we couldn't see their faces .

The women in the office doesn't listen and is down right rude.

My girlfriend and I had reservatiions for a Friday at 8:30.  We generally go to Delmonico's when we choose a high end steak type place, but we wanted to try something different.

The negative part first, the atmosphere.. We were unlucky enough to be seated at a tiny table with a long communal bench on one side, like one might be seated at the Cheesecake Factory, whose atmosphere is probably a bit nicer than Craftseak.  I sat on the bench side and my girlfriend in the chair opposite me.   The bench jolted and rocked any time one of us on it leaned back or was seated.  Diners on either side of us were about a foot away at most.   There was a couple to my left, and a group of four to my right.  Unfortunately the group of four included one ""loud talker""  An obnoxious one at that.   I could hear every word she (loud talker)  said, while straining to hear a word my girlfriend said over the surprisingly loud music (blues rock, an interesting choice).    Bright lights plus loud music plus diners on either side of us practically rubbing elbows equals just an awful atmosphere.  

Now, in fairness, being seated to an extremely loud person was just bad luck.  And if you happen to get a stand alone table, or one of the very nice looking semi-circular booths, as opposed to one of seats along the communal bench, your experience will be much better.  But still, the over all atmosphere with the loud music is just not very inviting.  When we left, we saw some people that had worse seats than we did. They were at a table in the middle of the bar area, and everyone that was leaving like us, or coming in to be seated had to practically brush up against them to get by.  I sure hope they just dropped in to see if there was a table available and didn't have reservations in advance.  It may sound a bit nit-picky to go on and on about the atmosphere, but if you are going to spend $300 to $400 for two, for a simple 3 course steak or seafood dinner, a nice atmosphere should be part of the package. 

On to the positive, the food.  The food was outstanding.   My girlfriend had the filet, and I had the surf and turf, with a filet and a half Maine lobster.   Unlike other reviewers here, our steaks were cooked perfectly.  Very rare for the girlfriend, and medium-rare for me.  Both were served exactly right.  The steaks and lobster were both about as good as they get.  The sides we ordered  were perfect as well.  We had tartare for an appetizer and it was simply amazing.   For dessert we had the monkey bread that other reviewers have raved about.  It was good, though nothing that special in my opinion.

So, absolutely no complaints on the food, nor the service for that matter.   You can't really get super attentive service when the only room the server has to stand in is directly behind the person in the chair.  But our waiter did his best under the circumstances, and the overall service was fine.   Also, our waiter was very helpful when we asked for help in selecting a wine, and ended up suggesting a  California Pinot that turnd out to be very good,  and at $96 was one of the least expensive wines on the list.

The simple fact is, there is nothing complicated about steaks and shellfish and classic sides like spinach,potatoes,asparagus, etc.  In the price range of Craftsteak, there are probably over a dozen restaurants in Las Vegas that can provide this fare every bit as delicious as Craftsteak presented, but with a nice atmosphere too.",3,3Riuwx_9xYhuqu0y1cuSFg

That's no knock on other bubble tea places, but nothing even comes close to Labothery.

Let's start with the obvious - the tea. It's delicious. The degree to which you can customize the tea basically gives you endless variations to play with, so you can literally never have the same tea twice. You can customize the flavors (taro, banana, etc.), the amount of sugar (no sugar, 30%, 50%, 100%), the base (condensed milk, regular milk, etc.), the type of tea (green, black, white, oolong), etc. Incredible. Just incredible.

The next most obvious thing - the decor. Also incredible. The ""theme"" is a laboratory. Everything looks like a laboratory. The flavors come in test tubes, the sweeteners come in syringes, the toppings come in petri dishes, and when you mix them all up, you get your bubble tea in a measuring cup. The staff are dressed in white labcoats. On the wall, there are bubble tea ""formulas"", etc. Very well done.

The drive from Scottsdale was a little longer than the other place we went a few years ago - but was well worth it.  The 2-hour ride got us towards the mountains and into some terrain that was up and down, around huge boulders and lots of plants.  My kids (9-16) didn't complain once.  James, our leader was friendly and helpful.  (and they have clean bathrooms)  We recommended this to friends who went the following week, and had an equally good experience.
We hope to be back in AZ in the future and will ride here again!",1,o8XyyKEGkaj6_WDIxmpFQw

Hyde Park was my wife's and my ""go to"" restaurant on the semi-rare occasion of wanting a red  meat dinner.  Never again.  It was the worst ""high end"" dining experience I have ever had.

To start: my wife's cocktail was made with the totally wrong ingredients, and was sent back.  The replacement arrived quickly with apologies.  We toasted each other and then ordered shortly thereafter.

Her salad appetizer was not what she ordered, and was removed and eventually replaced by the correct one.  The onion soup, which I has always loved at this restaurant, looked and tasted like dishwater with a few onions and cover with cheese.  Uneatable.  The waiter replaced it with a lobster bisque, which was quite good.  So far they missed badly on 3 out of 4.

I ordered the 40 day dry aged bone in NY sirloin with peppercorn sauce on the side, prepared medium rare ($59.00), and my wife ordered the lamb chops.  My  steak arrived looking similar to very well burnt shoe leather and one bite confirmed it, and my wife's lamb was kind of OK.  The baked potato was really good!  Their featured wine arrived with the meal, and it was kind of like Two Buck Chuck (if you can remember that rot gut).

I sent the steak back not to be replaced, and my wife did semi-enjoy her lamb chops. 

By that time management was aware that our meal was a disaster, and a young man came and burbled at our table about how sorry they were and if they could do anything, please let him know.  He continued to say this for at least 1 1/2 minutes; again and again.  I finally asked him to go away.

He did adjust the check, charging only for my cocktail, my wife's chops, and the wine.  He also gave us a $25.00 gift card, so I am pretty certain he thought all was well.

We had a meal that we had both been looking forward to totally ruined.  Wrong drinks, wrong and horrid appetizers, 1 inedible steak and 1 barely edible label lamb chops, and rot gut wine.

What the hell happened to one of our once favorite restaurants?  A new steak house is opening less than a mile away from Hyde Park.  We'll go there and hopefully have a fine meal, or to the close by Red's or Fleming's.

What a terrible meal exacerbated by a a fool of a manager. 

And really, I am a nice guy.",6,MwTVg1Esta1PJLGfqTUs1w

I had the char su ramen with thick noodles and my fianc√©e had char su ramen with thin noodles. They did not refill our drinks and we had to ask numerous times only to be forgotten again. The menu selection is not extensive and if you cannot tell the difference between thick noodles and thin noodles then you probably should not be working there as my waiter had no idea !

I took a little drive to Dowtown to check it out.

I drove there and got online. once I got inside there were several lines going to the counter area. You need to see a small sign indicating what station it serves, for instance the carne asada tacos are in one line and the pork tacos are in another. 

It was really packed inside and the lines were long. Once I got my tacos it was all worth it.

I had 6 carne asada tacos (they are small) and they load them up with qacamole, cilantro and onions. Make sure you ask for the jalape√±o and onion side.

I will be back here, Fyi there is another location on the strip, however the lines there are huge.

Down fall is they need to move the fountain drinks to a different location. They keep them in a tiny corner next to the kitchen door. It got really packed in there and I had to wait a while for people to get out of the tiny corner.",0,p85Lq9SorEmHjhLZg3l0cw

I was about to head over to 7th Street Public Market for some coffee, but I saw that this place had coffee too so I came in to check it out. 

Earl's Grocery caters to your many needs. It is a bakery and a coffee bar; it has prepared foods and an assortment of cheeses and wine. The bakery goods really caught my attention. Some of their desserts included BOOZY brown sugar creme brulee, push cake pops, pumpkin cheesecakes, cream cheese brownies and more! For someone who isn't the biggest fan of sweets, I was definitely intrigued by their selection. I can't say that their dessert was to die for, but they were pretty good. I recommend the pumpkin cheesecake because it doesn't taste artificial and it isn't too sweet. 

They also have a unique selection of chocolates. While they are a little pricey, these are flavors that you can't really find in a regular market *(maybe TJ's). As far as the interior of the establishment, it looks like regular seating for a restaurant, but they have an ample amount of outlets for you to do work or charge your phone like me. They also have an assortment of board games which is a great touch. I'll definitely be coming back here to hang out in the future.",1,SJEr0t98Op8WDVjhttkKLA

Which we will never next time we're in town. 

We travel to Mont Tremblant to ski often and always make it a stop to do a day in Montreal and have actually been to this very place last year and enjoyed it. I don't know what happened this time but here's the rundown. 

We arrived around 4:30 on a Saturday and the place was full. We got a table and the only reason for the two stars is because of the 'game attendants' who were very nice and the selection of games. However the, I'm guessing manager, and the waitress need a serious lesson on customer service. Right away we received a bit of an attitude from both when we didn't respond to them in 'Quebec-French'....not traditional French and we're not in Paris so get over yourselves please. All the surrounding provinces speak English, get over it. We each ordered double Bulleit bourbon neat and nachos and that was the last we EVER saw our waitress except when she quickly dumped off our microwaved cheese covered chips with two small cocktail napkins and no plates or anything. Never came back once to check on us and our glasses stayed empty the entire hour we were there. Granted they were busy but that is no excuse I've been a bartender for 13 years and even when I'm in the weeds I make it a point to check on everyone at least once. 

The worst part is the 'manager' went around EVERY table around us and gave waters which we were told were 'self serve' by the waitress and brought two other tables right around us second rounds and additional games. He chatted them all up in their native language while we were completely ignored and when we wanted to change games I had to get up and track down a 'game attendant' on my own. It was pretty pathetic.  

We decided to leave as we were treated way better at other surrounding haunts and the 'manager' asked ""leaving already?"" To which I replied ""yes well we couldn't get drinks from the waitress for about an hour so we are leaving"" and he said AND I QUOTE ...""oh well"". I scoffed and couldn't believe what he said. 

There was a line of local nerds out the door that I'm sure will get much better service than us English speaking American tourists. The sad thing is I'm a 13 year bartender that has worked all over the United States from Miami to Manhattan and for DECENT service I tip 25% on the ENTIRE bill.  Including the insane Canadian tax, because that's just what I do. Not here. For the first time ever in my life I told my husband as he filled out the tip...""let's get the hell out of here just give her 15% the last time we saw her face it was on a milk carton"".

I also creeped photos of the food many times and I was happy to finally try Smugglers.  Located on Macleod Trail SW and in the same complex as Tango, they have their own parking lot.  If that's full you'll have to find parking on the street somewhere and walk a bit.  My sister could only get a reservation for 8:15PM but we were fine with it because we had things to do beforehand.

We arrived on time and got seated right away.  I found the environment to be very...old school, country with a bit of a pirately vibe...haha maybe it's the name?  The lights were quite dim but it was alright.  I read about the salad bar so I was excited about that.  As we were looking at the menus, some dishes came by which looked delicious.  There were 5 of us total, 3 went with the smugglers inn cut for prime rib, I went with the prime rib sandwich, and my younger brother went with the lamb.  All of our meals came with the soup and salad bar.  Our waiter gave waters and ice tea as requested and took our order.  After, he pointed to where the soup/salad bar and we walked around the corner to grab some food.  There was a nice selection of salads: greens, pasta, noodle and waldorf salads with many different dresses and fixings as well as some fruit and jello in the salad bar.  There were 3 soups available that night: steak soup, some bean soup and another one that I had forgotten about and some bread and butter.  We put some croutons in an empty bowl and filled it up with soup.  The steak soup didn't have any pieces of steak in but it was tasty, almost like a tomatoy thick soup, salty as expected.  We then went for some salad, my older brother made himself a beet salad because he loves beets and the rest of us got a little bit of everything.  I grabbed a soup bowl and filled it with jello : ) hehe 

Shortly after we finished our salads, the mains came out.  My brothers lamb looked delicious, 3 generously sized pieces of lamb, side of beans and a half tomato.  I've never been a fan of lamb but I wanted to have a taste...he really enjoyed it but it's just not my thing, I find it gamey and I don't think it tastes all that great but that's just me and lamb.  Both my other brother and Kenny got a piece of prime rib with a bone in them, my sister got a normal piece without bone and my prime rib sandwich looked just as good as the smugglers cut just a little smaller.  Each of the smugglers cuts came with yorkshire pudding, beans and half tomato and my 'sandwich' came with a piece of garlic bread,  yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes.  I tasted a piece of my rib with some horseradish and it was juicy but tough.  I thought it was just mine because I had the sandwich but my sister gave me a taste of her and it tasted the exact same, juicy but tough.  I wasn't overly satisfied with the prime rib, maybe because my sister and Kenny hyped it up but they weren't happy either.  They said it was tougher than normal and just wasn't the time as their previous visits.  I did say that it was later in the night so maybe it's the scraps of the last batch but it shouldn't be that tough.  Although not the best, it was edible but, there were a lot of fatty pieces.  The horseradish was perfect, not too nostril burning, it did help with the eating the prime rib.

Overall, my first experience at Smugglers was not as enjoyable as I pictured.  I had high expectations from word of mouth and reading reviews but it just didn't measure up.  Over waiter was great though, attentive and cracking small jokes here and there.  We did ask to see the neat dessert menu which is pretty neat.  We left, full but not completely satisfied.

Hopefully if I visit again, I will go earlier in the day.",4,z6J7nfLtw0GeXOhgas_lHg

I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks).

hyM_SJdBeL6SYA-kfNhBag,0,2014-09-01 15:51:58,0,b0w6vqX3RqpIVZXJQ4nH1g,"Staycations on the Labor Day weekend have been a tradition in my family for the past 6 years.  The most recent stay was selected by an 8 year old and based off the photos of the swimming pools in comparison to the other resorts in the Valley - Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak won.  

I am told that this resort is one of the cheaper ones in the Valley and more family oriented.  So I kept that in mind as I walked around the unimpressive grounds to get to my hotel room.   It's obvious to see the similarities between the Pointe Squaw Peak and the Arizona Grand which was originally the Pointe South Mountain.  I think that location has been kept up better than Squaw Peak.  There's nothing worth mentioning about the hotel room except that the bathroom was small and dated. 

The reason for the trip revolved around the pools though.  The River Ranch has a lazy river that's incredibly narrow.  In some areas two inner tubes could not pass side by side, it hard to keep from playing footsies with strangers.  Since I was there on a holiday weekend the pool staff asked hotel guests to exit the lazy river once they reached the entrance again.  Laziness was kept to a minimum.  The swimming pools at the River Ranch were long and narrow.  One pool had a water fall but it looked cloudy as fug, I didn't go in there once.  The other pool at the River Ranch has a basket ball hoop and volleyball net.  There are two other pools outside of the River Ranch, both have bars but there are no swim up bars on the property, I checked.  My mom knows that I Yelp and she wanted me to mention that Justin, a server at the pool was rude to her and that there are no cabanas for rent.
  
Another reason for the low stars would be the culture that the hotel offers.  The lack of trust between the hotel and guest is so off putting that it became an annoyance.  There's a large presence of security on the grounds and they stand post in different areas.  In order to get a towel at the pool, guests have to fill out their name, room number, signature and number of towels and then be assigned a number to be written on your wrist band.  If you do not bring back your towels, you will be charged $25 per towel.  So at the end of the day, I had to carry 8 wet towels all the way to the entrance of the waterpark and wait in line to return it, so much for the resort life.  If you want to play with a ball, you have to deposit your ID.  If you want to run a tab, you need a credit card.  I wouldn't get served without an ID.  Who brings their wallet down to the hotel pool?  During my stay, I met one person who lost their ID and two people who lost their credit cards at the pool.  I blame the hotel, how is someone supposed to keep their ID and credit cards secure while swimming?  Then the more days I stayed there, it became obvious that the hotel needs these rules in effect because the quality of guests it attracts require a lot of rules to keep them in line.  It was like a prison, gaurds vs inmates.  Adults that don't know how to behave in public (screaming at and bullying kids, behaving drunk, wearing jean shorts at swimsuits) seem to frequent this resort hence the heavy security and signs that need to remind people to not put chairs in the pool.
The Pointe Squaw Peak has to be the saddest property in the Hilton's range of resorts.  The only way I'd ever come back is if Hilton did a total renovation and got rid of the dated apartment complex look.  It's a beautiful location but an ugly resort.",8,TQ9A1LVp6z-fIc494RsLDQ

They changed the decor completely to brown on the insides and even covered up the designed cubby holes that use to hold the gum balls on the side which was kind of dumb because that wall looks funny now sunk in. No music and the girls that were working were just as quite as can be and didn't greet us until we said something. But the place isn't about decor or the workers really, it's about the cupcakes!

Now if I remember correctly it is $3.75 per cupcake. $23 for half a dozen and about $45 for a dozen, just a guess because we bought the half a dozen. We came in on the 9th and when we got home we had a couple in our box we didn't tell her we wanted, we ordered the snicker-doodle and the oreo ones but instead got the poppyseed and coconut.  
Me and my boyfriend cut them all in half and here is our shared review of what we tried:

Poppyseed: Frosting is just whipped butter! No joke, If you like straight butter and some sugar this is for you. The cupcake itself is Angel food cake with poppyseed's in it so it tasted just like a muffin rather than an actual cupcake because of the butter. 

Coconut: Whipped butter frosting, same as the poppyseed frosting except this one is covered in coconut flakes and sparkles. It's a light white cake batter they use with coconut flakes.

Red Velvet: It tasted just like Chocolate cake with red food coloring. Had a cream cheese frosting.

Raspberry Lemon: This one was the best out of all of them, it was really good and not ordinary. It had real lemon zest in the cake part and real raspberry's whipped into the frosting.

Strawberry: Good, not an over-powering taste like I expected it to be. More strawberry taste than sweet.

Confetti: Basic good old fashion confetti cake with white vanilla frosting. 

Now let me tell you anyone who likes cupcakes are going to say that this place is really good. Who can go wrong with a cup cake!? At least the ones I tried were the very basic simple recipes that can be baked from home and nothing that wow'ed me as far as cupcakes go but then again we didn't try all of them. We will be back because it is a good location to stop in and get a treat while shopping. They also serve drinks and coffee I believe too.",3,yEeClTP1kPV0zKjJmt-UAQ

They have a couple of pool tables, which are always filled up. Plenty of tv's to watch any game/fight/etc. And they also have 2 bars, one next to the dancefloor so ease of getting a drink is pretty good.

Cost was $115. They also give a guarantee and if CRA comes with questions just direct them to this office.

I am not sure what the others complain about, I think it's all a matter of comparison: two other accountants I talked to quoted me $200 and at least two weeks preparation time.

I found out today she went to Dr. Saxe last year for her wisdom teeth and highly recommends him! All the girls that work there are very sweet.

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",0,YnMHlGm6XX1MtnKqiSgDIA

we ordered:
smoked salmon toasts
shrimp ceviche
tuna tartare
stuffed dates
thai beef salad
manchego mac n cheese
albondigas
chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms
lamb skewers

I am so glad that we did.  While I balked at how much we spent, I can't help but remember how good everything was, and that it is definitely worth it.

We brought my other mom, mother-in-law, because she has a special appreciation for all things downtown and she had been wanting to try this place as well.  This place really is beautiful.  There is a modern edge to everything, but it's styled in a way that makes you feel incredibly comfortable here.  The staff is all unbelievably nice and friendly.  We were greeted with ""Happy Mother's Day"" all the way outside by the valet attendants to the inside by our server.  Not one staff member walked by without saying it.  That's a nice touch.

Now the food.  WOW!  The buffet line was beautifully set up and was filled to the brim with excellent food.  I sampled, and then some, so much food that I thought I would burst.  I'm going to present this in list form because it's just easier that way.
-French Toast Casserole: Sweet and tasty.  Like bread pudding in pecan roll form.
-Scrambled Eggs - Light and fluffy and well seasoned.
-Yogurt Parfait - Served in a martini glass with seriously good granola.
-Bacon - Very good and cooked well.
-Sausage - From Schreiners, very good but a tad to spicy for breakfast (at least for me)
-Biscuits & Gravy - Different.  It wasn't very sausagey but I really enjoyed the taste of it.  It was not as heavy as normal B&G.
-Fresh Fruit - The berries were served in shot glasses and were so perfect I couldn't believe it.  
-Mac&Cheese - Definitely not my style, it was really boring to me, I would actually be upset if I ordered it.
-Chocolate Mousse Cake - INCREDIBLE.  I wish I wasn't so stuffed at this point of my meal to actually enjoy it more.  The cake was super moist and dense, but the mousse inside was amazing.  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.

I couldn't have been more pleased with this place.  Everything was delicious and beautiful.  I felt strangely at ease here.  It seems to be a fancy place, but it wasn't pretentious like I had expected.  We had such a wonderful time, and our server Jeff was fantastic.  One thing I was so amused with was every time an employee saw a napkin unfolded, they would twist it around and make it look nice again.

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of ""hipster"" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their ""square"" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting.

The menu is very limited and the prices are ~$10 for everything.  I ordered the grilled cheese... it took much longer than it should in my opinion.  My friends got all their food before me, and I ordered first.... does that make sense?  Grilled cheese for $10 is not worth it.. even if there is lobster in it.  It didn't satisfy me and the combination of fishy + cheesey did not work here.  I tried a little of my friend's lobster mac and cheese... it did not work in any favor.

It's like, our apartment looks expensive and cheap all at the same time (because the paint continuously chips off the doors and what not).

We also do not like that we have to pay for valet trash. $360 a year for a company to throw our trash out is a bit of a waste to us since we don't live far from the trash area. Especially since when we do put our trash out, they don't always take it all (which baffles me. Why am I paying for them to take only most of my trash?).

Other than that, I'd say we like Sardis Place quite a bit. It seems like the new management is really trying to make this place more homey and spiffy. The employees have always been really great to us, and my boyfriend and I are actually a little confused by the other reviews saying that the employees aren't great.

The 2 Bedroom, 2 Bathroom has Washer/Dryer in unit, granite countertops, dishwasher, stove, microwave, fridge. One room has a completely private bathroom, the other has access from the room and from the living area. We have queen beds in our rooms, they fit very comfortably, a king would also fit. My only complaint about the rooms is that there is no fan (in the room or bathrooms) and no overhead light. 

I am a big fan of the kitchen. For an apartment, it has a pretty decent amount of storage. I cook a LOT, so I have a lot of stuff to cook with. I only have 1.5 boxes of kitchen stuff that wouldn't fit (which is amazing to me since I have 17 different pots and pans). 

As far as we've seen, the community has a pool, dog park, and a lot of run around area for kids to play. Our neighbors mostly keep to themselves, and we never see anyone, but it could also be that we work weird hours.

If I think of more, I will keep adding. I hope this helps!",2,x0kOk7unyMfAVX4gt3KS8A

Elegantly decorated in rich, dark colours, low lighting, upscale furniture and an intimate ambiance, this place is great to bring a date to.  

The menu is contemporary Italian, with it's decent selection of anitpasti's, pastas and mains.  If I ever see beef carpaccio on the menu I have to get it as a base of comparison.  For mains we got the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the butternut squash and veal stuffed ravioli(?) with pistachios and truffle oil.  

Carpaccio was beautifully pink, super vibrant colouring, with a fresh taste to boot.  Pastas were good not great, nothing to really complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  I'd say the stuffed Veal pasta was better than my pappardelle as it had more depth of flavours and textures.  The pistachios were a fun inclusion.

For dessert we split the apple strudel with pear compote and vanilla ice cream.  The pastry itself wasn't hot enough and thus not flaky enough to  cut up with my fork - it felt like I had to fight with it in order to break off a piece.  Meanwhile the ice cream was still very frozen and rock solid. 

The service was very friendly and polite albeit a little smothering.  Our waiter would come by every 3 minutes to ask us something and thank us profusely when we accepted his offer to refill our water glasses.

$100 for two, an app, a cocktail, two mains, cappacino and dessert.  Pretty reasonable.  To be fair, I would like to give Carisma 3.5 stars, as it was a pleasant dining experience. I just can't see myself wanting to go back.",5,6b4yYexmPQglmNdNum531Q

The service is fantastic and we were treated with professional staff.  The first night we went a strong chemical smell was overpowering.  We ended up politely declining.  Even the staff said they were getting a headache.  Apparently they were sealing the pool and it was coming through the vents.  We decided to reschedule our reservation  and they automatically comped us our cocktails and desert the following evening.  The odor was completely gone and we had a great meal.

The salads are huge!  My dining partner had the iceberg wedge and I had the barbeque chicken salad.  Both were way bigger than they probably should be.  The iceberg wedge was pretty standard but the barbeque chicken salad was anything but.  It was loaded with avacado and the barbeque flavor was excellent..  For the main course I had seared scallops and my dining partner had the petite filet.  Both were nicely sized portions and we took food home.  We each ordered a side dish which was a mistake.  The sides are huge and plenty big enough to split.  She had the macaroni and cheese and I had the mushroom pot pie.  The mushroom pot pie was so rich it was like eating desert!  Three bites of it and I was full.  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it with seafood.  It's heavy and overwhelms a delecate dish but woud have been awesome with the filet.  I tasted the mac and cheese which was also really rich and quite yummy.  We had the Key Lime Pie for desert which was a petite portion but plenty enough.  We both thought the place was a good value. It's a young hip crowd and the music is pretty load.  Don't go her for a quiet romantic dinner but the place is definitely a Hard Rock brand of fine dining.

He says, ""Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!"" Uhm, there's that in this city? Am thinking, my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm, a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay, he picks me up and off we go. Initially, he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago, and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).

Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!

Like a ""starved"" woman, I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter, the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course, I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite, fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers, garlic, oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic, oh my! Then so, I got a hold of the oregano, hot red dried pepper, garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These, are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese. 

Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em, this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions, olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness, tasty tomato sauce, and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto, mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah, hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated, as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You, am talking to you! Go munch on a pizza yumm pizza!",8,l1CtGHiqB349YrmxjIcgng

         P.S. Can we please stop serving pot stickers on a bed of shredded lettuce! It's not fancy... it's sad!!!

Beef & Broccoli: Average. But what made it average was the beef! The sauce was great, which made the broccoli great! However the beef had a weird flavor that none of us liked.

House Fried Rice: Average. This is another one of my ""it is what it is"" moments. Its fried rice, not great, not bad, just fried rice.

Pulled Pork Peking: Good... I think. This one is odd... but good... but odd... but good... but still odd. First of all, It's not PULLED pork. It's chunks of pork, which isn't bad, just not what was expected. Regardless, the dish had great flavor, but in my opinion, and my friend's as well, the dish was overly sweet.

But they wanted me to sign that I would buy that car... hmmmm.  Couldn't test drive it and it had problems...  Well, they brought out the credit guy, who once again talked to my friend instead of me, and shook his hand twice, but not mine.  The numbers did not match what was advertised at all.  There was $1000 added on to the price, now making a car that had a Kelley Blue Book value of $3400 from $6700 to $7700.  They said the higher price was a loan fee.  I was sitting under the sign that said ""We use Kelley Blue Book values to price our cars"".  Obviously not the same blue book the rest of us use.

The moral of this story is, do your homework to know the value of your purchase before you buy from these guys... and ladies, you might want to bring a guy with you so you don't have to shake their hands either.",2,W7bByp6fXWacskCjA1sWLw

As we were sitting in the restaurant I was on yelp reading the reviews peeps have written on this place.  I think some of were smoking crack when you wrote your review.   This place is NOTHING like Chilis! The menu is large but it has a fabulous selection of items to choose from.  I started off with the coconut shrimp skewers and a artichoke dip.  Both were wonderful!   For dinner I ordered the Micau   Shrimp soup and salad. It was fabulous!  if you ask for more broth, less egg noodles it is a very healthy low calorie dish that is full of steamed veggies!    My husband ordered a steak and our kiddos had ribs.

So we ordered the ice cream cake with Oreo crust. It was very good.  The kids had ice cream sundaes that came with their meals.   I think this place is very nice.  Our waiter, Tim, was very attentive even though the place was packed!   It was still very busy when we arrived at 8pm. We waited about 20 to sit .  The atmosphere is very lively and fun.

Within, it contains the best Mexican food that I've had anywhere. Most places that I eat, I wonder, why is this or this even on the plate, it's unpalatable and excessive. Jalisco is the place where my wife and I literally eat all of the sauce, every drop of food and liquid on the plate. Everything tastes homemade and delicious. It it never crowded and always provides great food and quick service. We have easily eaten here over 30 times and this is our go to place when we expect a great and affordable meal. Our total ticket price for two people is usually $20 or less. I'm very happy this place is not located in Phoenix or anywhere popular as I enjoy have a private spot that no one seems to know about. 

The fish tacos are the way fish tacos should taste. Tasty, fresh, crunchy, with a midly spicy sauce that is to die for. The enchiladas have the best sauce we have ever tasted. I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person. I'm convinced that the only reason most restaurants are open is because people have no where else to go. Jalisco earns it place.",2,rn-_cjZ8CPKXgORgaueWzw

I have four children under the age of six years old. I've been a patient of Dr. Echols for six years now.
i've never had a problem with Dr. Echols, as a matter fact she was always very kind to me and my family also Dr. Jerome has a really good sense of humor with my children and he is very fun to be around.. there was also a new doctor in there that I got to see on emergency appointments only that was also pretty good except for Dr. Lepore. 
Let me begin by saying what a terrible attitude towards his patients, it's almost as if he wasn't meant to be a pediatrician.
On one of my visits to Kid Fixers my four-year-old went to the bathroom and I guess she left some kind a mess behind., dr. Lepore stormed out to the waiting room checking me for my daughters mess she left behind.. I apologized right away Took care of the mess happily but couldn't believe the way he was taking it to the heart after all these are kids that don't know everything about life yet..
my second encounter with Dr. Lepore..
One morning I had called to make an urgent appointment to be seen with my daughter, supposedly I was told that it was going to be with Dr. Lepore. Sadly things got worse with my daughter and had to rush to the emergency room not having enough time to call and cancel the appointment.. 
Two weeks later I got a letter from Kid Fixers pediatrics stating that they were terminating future visits with all of my children signed by Dr. Lepore.

I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...

Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! 

Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  

Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! 

The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. 

Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it.

7hkHJ2LyA0F1wC8as4euEg,0,2015-08-13 20:00:28,0,wsnzUn5QCTQbDKMKUY9RLQ,"Our 5-year-old has been taking swim lessons at Little Otter (Huntersville) for a few months now.  He has previously taken swim lessons at the YMCA and through HFFA.

Positives:  The facility seems very clean, and the organization seems to be run like a tight ship.  

Cons:  Little Otter is desperately lacking in customer service skills, and the experience is completely impersonal.  Some examples:  
(1)  When we first signed up our son to start lessons in the Spring, we looked up the descriptions of the different classes and chose the appropriate class based on where he was at the end of last summer.  During the first lesson, after only being in water for a few minutes, a staff member rushed over and insisted that our 5-year-old be moved to a beginner class with 2-year-olds.  My husband explained that our son was (understandably) rusty after not being in the water for a year, and that they needed to give him an opportunity to prove his abilities before making that call.  Sure enough, within a few lessons our son was outpacing the other kids in his class.  If Little Otter had had their way, they would have had him with the 2-year-olds blowing bubbles, and he never would have progressed.
(2) The lessons are completely impersonal.  I have spoken to our son's coach once for a few minutes the entire time we have been at Little Otter.  (And that was at one of the evaluations, which take place every 6 weeks.  If you miss that you are NOT given an opportunity to make it up.  Therefore your child is not evaluated and given the opportunity to move up, even if he/she is ready.)  I would be shocked if anyone at Little Otter knows my name.  At HFFA, you could have as much communication with the coaches as you needed, which made it easier to work on the skills outside of lessons.
(3) You can only make up 1 class per month, which is particularly unfair in the summer (Little Otter's busiest season for lessons also coincides with every family's busiest travel season).  The classes are not cheap (roughly $15/session), so missing a few classes is costly.  
(4) Little Otter requires 30 days notice to stop the lessons.  We have never experienced that with gymnastics, soccer, or basketball lessons.  That is incredibly inconvenient for parents and seems unreasonable.",1,yAlpIZhkEOnz_IJzXr6YaQ

Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd ""go and check on it"", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.

So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.

I had planned to enjoy more of the spiced pancakes on National Pancake Day, but the Pumpkin pancake breakfast only comes with one pumpkin pancake, and I wanted at least a two-stack.  I'd meant to ask if I may request for another cake, but forgot when I placed my order for blueberry pancakes.  I thought mom would enjoy the mushroom frittata, since it was a clear favorite amongst friends during the Make A Wish Yelp event last month.  I asked her if she liked it, and she said she did, but I think she enjoyed the pancakes, with blueberry compote and bacon more.  I do know that she really liked the ciabatta toast paired with the goat cheese that sat atop of the frittata.  I found the pancakes a tad sweeter than I like them, but I enjoyed the pancakes' textures.  These cakes were big, too, so great value there.  The bacon were four for $4.80, and I found them to be too salty.  Will skip them next time.  

Good food from a seasonal menu and consistent, friendly service will bring us back, and what makes me admire this restaurant chain (and I try to avoid national chains) even more are:

-the paper-based to-go boxes!
-pure maple syrup offered (add'l fee; less than $2 in a refillable travel-sized bottle)!
-carafes of coffee and water on table!

Will try other pancake varieties, something from FW Eggs-clusives menu, and perhaps a sandwich on our next visit!",78,M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA

I was very excited to see that Smalls had begun to fill that space vacated by NoFo and Mexi Cafe and on such a great street that has gems like Customshop and Elizabeth Creamery.

I hit the jack pot ordering. Holy chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and the syrup was just sweet enough without being over-powering. My friends kept eating off my plate. This is a must have item. 

My friends however where not blown away. Hence- the reason for a three star review. We enjoyed the fried pickles but the sliders were dubbed ""eh"" and not even finished- rare for this group. The flatbread was not anything special. I adore how the beer and wine are all local and all the food is made to order.

This place is a bit different since you have to pay upfront before going into the buffet. It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.  

They have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor. 

I'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location. Also, I saw a bunch of Indian people when we walked in so that must mean this place is good!

After looking over the menu I decided to order a beer and a roll of sushi (let me clarify) ONE roll of sushi, and my friend decided to get some ramen. After about 10 mins go by, they bring out the ramen but no sushi. I wasn't in a huge rush so no worries - I understand it can get busy in the kitchen. Five mins go by, then ten, then 15, and finally 20. By this time my friend had completely finished his meal, I had finished my beer, and the hour of parking I paid for was 10 mins to expiring. 

Let me also add, halfway through my friend eating, they decided to ask for ID as they wanted to open up the partition between the patio and restaurant. He's only 20 but this issue shouldn't arise halfway through a paying customers meal.

My server, Sage, had came to our table several times during this wait amazed I still didn't have my food and actually checked back to the kitchen 2-3 times for me before I finally received it (she was great). But I have never in my life had to wait 30 mins for a roll of sushi. 

Upon receiving my food, the manager decides to come over to explain how ramen takes two mins to make while sushi somehow takes 30 mins (because it's an ""entree"" and somehow ramen isn't?) - all he could say was ""I understand, BUT..."". All he needed to say was, ""I apologize is there anything I can do to make it better?"" - that would have made the difference between me writing this yelp review or not.

He offered me free edamame but seeing as I had just gotten my ""entree"" and had finished my beer, I countered the offer by asking if they could refill my glass so I had something to enjoy my meal with; he begrudgingly accepted. However, when I got the bill I was charged $8 for a draft beer - even if I had gone to a club up the street I would have paid max $5.50 to $6 for the same product accompanied by better service, and better management. I paid the bill, tipped the waitress and got out of there before anything else could go wrong. All in all, this place is a JOKE.

Now put that cow tongue on my human tongue. Aw yis!

Anywho, let's cut the chitchat and jump right into the review.  Depending what you order, the portions can be either pretty generous or really skimpy.  Like the pork belly here are ridiculously tiny and extremely frozen.  This bacon comes to you ready to plank [y'all remember when planking was a thing?].  I didn't enjoy how a lot of the thicker cut items were frozen as it made the meat steam.  I want that char-grilled goodness!  The marinades and seasoning are definitely on the softer hand of things as well.  The Sesame Marinated Beef, Angus Prime Brisket, Beef Tongue, Octopus, and Marinated Beef Rib Finger Meat were decent.  Everything else was pretty basic.  The steamed egg is something you should try and the cheese corn is something you can pass on.  The meat quality is pretty average.

When our first round of goods got to the table, our server dumped all our entrees onto the grill and all I could think about was how that raw chicken was tainting my beef tongue.  Since tongue cooks up a lot faster than chicken, I cringed and made sure to overcook the heck out of the tongue to avoid salmonella.  Overcrowding the grill with five entrees also didn't help with the cooking.  Everything was just steaming by that point.  After the second round of food, we asked our server to just set the dishes down and let us grill it ourselves and at our own pace.  The service was pretty sparse and flagging our waitress down to order more food was a challenge as they were shorthand and it was quite busy.  There were long periods where we just sat around staring at our dirty grill [which we did have to call someone over to change] while either waiting for food, waiting for water refills, or waiting for our waitress to reappear so we can order more food.  Also, perhaps it was just our table, but our grill had some uneven heat going on.

This place also has the worst ventilation system.  We all know you'll end up getting smoky at KBBQ but this was like tear gas status.  It was insanely smoky and one of my friends had to step outside because she was starting to feel ill from all the smoke.

They are more about selling you services and units but when I needed them to check a noise in my AC and the AC stops working during tinkering around with it they blame the thermostat that they installed in the first place.

Basically we are in their hands.
I spoke to an IT friend and he recommended me buying my own modem and router, then going to just connect service. I went in and explained my situation.

The first time we sat at the pizza bar which is a Great place to sit and watch your pizza being made in the wood fire oven! A show must have let out shortly after we arrived because there was a rush of people at the door suddenly and they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait! We split the carnivore pizza which was absolutely delicious! Bacon, pepperoni, and sausage- the dough was delicious as well!They have a great craft beer selection, the wine prices seemed to high to me, but everything else seemed priced appropriately. I'd also recommend the Bianca pizza or the Forrest if you are looking for a veggie pizza. I've also eaten here for lunch, which was not as satisfying so the ""star ratings"" are really based on my dinner experiences. I ordered the chicken caprese puccia(balsamic-marinated chicken breast / house-cured black pepper bacon / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-made basil pesto / house mozzarella) The bread completely overwhelmed the sandwich and when I opened it up to see how big the piece of chicken was it was literally half the size of my palm! I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all! My boyfriend had the soup special (chilled pepper with scallops) and the special for lunch (pork and spaetzle with pancetta). he too commented on the size of his entree which looked more like an appetizer but it was tasty. The soup (besides the chips which again were amazing but that's not a reason to return anywhere) was I think the highlight for both of us.

The portions are good if you're not hungry. For example, I got the lunch special with a Zo's Chopped Side Salad and Chicken Picatta Bigoli. The salad was good, but honestly it was about the size of a Wendy's $1 side salad. The pasta reminded me of a Pasta Roni side dish, not very flavorful.

And Haru really deserves it.

Yes I live in McKenzie, but there's no bias - just sheer luck to have a great sushi place in the neighbourhood. I'd drive long distances if needed, glad I can just walk in.

Service is the best part of the experience - these guys are genuine, attentive, polite, and just fun to deal with - always smiling, friendly, jumping in to fulfil every need you may possibly have.

Good menu. I guess I've eaten all of it back and forth, and would love to see more items on it, but still - good stuff, enough to choose from for a while.

Needless to say, I've been to Haru almost every other weekend for more than a year, and neither me nor my wife had ever encounter something that won't be fresh and carefully prepared. We love that.

Another big plus is that Haru folks are so accommodating - when we arrive with our little one, they always help moving a stroller so it won't bother anyone, and give us a table which allows stuffing the baby seat in.

And the most important, it's not just about us, our family - we regularly observe the same level of respect and attention to the rest of the customers.

Fernando and Henry were amazing.  They steam cleaned all the stains/spots out of my seats and floor mats.  My cup holders were no longer sticky.

Everyone was very content with their food.  I ordered the bone marrow--which I thought was a little plain and too thick for my liking because I'm used to it spreading like butter--and escargot--which were good but did not have enough sauce or butter on them. I also ordered the bouillabaisse which was delicious and a very good sized portion (I would recommend sharing). I also tried some of the foie gras-stuffed burger and thought it also delicious, and you can definitely taste a hint of the foie gras, but it wasn't overpowering (my friend liked it and she doesn't typically like foie gras).  Their cocktails were very good too; we ordered the negroni, sidecar, cucumber collins, and old phoenician.

He is very personable, accommodating and always makes certain that you understand your treatment plan and always listens and answers any questions you may have. The entire staff is pleasant to deal with as well. The front desk ladies always serve you with a smile and the assistants (Angela specifically) are always ready to help you with whichever treatment needs to be done.

2  The Ramen - Just right Al Dente

3.  The choices -  All sorts of choices, additional toppings, larger size with more noodles and etc.

4.  The key points - I like the pork tenderloin in any ramen. I also like the flavor of green onion sliced and cooked to perfection. 

5.  Parking - Has parking, in it's own lot, however, the traffic direction seems to be a bit odd, seems that the entrance is two way, yet large enough for only one car.

6.  Service and Seating - Small, be prepared to wait, nice service, and very busy.

Strike 1: Lack of communication between staff. When we walked to the front door, a staff member politely opened the door for us. However, as we walked by him to enter into the restaurant, he said that no tables were currently available. He was just in the process of telling us the wait time, when one of the other staff members stated that we could be seated right away. At least check the tables before you turn customers away.

Strike 2: Water did not arrive at the table until after 20 minutes of being seated. PLUS, the ""Sweet"" Tea was NOT sweet at all. Water and Sweet Tea were requested, but we were left waiting and thirsty. The place was not packed with customers, and water/sweet tea should not take long to bring to the table.

Strike 3: My boyfriend, of all people, did not receive his entree until the rest of the table had just about finished their meals! He ordered the Seafood Delight, which is a combination of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops in marinara sauce over linguine for $19.95. I understand that it is a large dish and has a lot of components to it, but if it's not almost ready, don't bring out the rest of the table's meals yet, keep the other dishes heated on warmers in the kitchen. The waitress said it would be about 4 more minutes. It took a lot longer than 4 minutes. It did not take the rest of the table only 4 minutes to finish their meals. We were not speed-eating. We were chatting and enjoying our meals at a decent pace. PLUS, the waitress brought extra bread to the table when we still had plenty of bread, and there was clearly no more space for bread, except in front of my boyfriend, where his actual entree belonged. We were utterly confused. None of us had requested more bread. It was as if the waitress thought it would make things better if she brought more bread instead of the entree. We ended up having to wait on my boyfriend.

In terms of the other food, the Fried Calamari ($9.95) was chewy and the skin covering was pale and unappealing. It did not have the nice crisp to it that I was expecting. The Del Boscaiola (Parmesan cream sauce with prosciutto and peas for $11.25) was delicious. I chose Cappellini noodles. I enjoyed the sauce. There were far too many peas, but I didn't mind. The Seafood Delight should be shared. In terms of portion, it is too much for one person. I do like the shrimp and scallop. However, the presentation is sloppy.

Strike 4: I asked if they did anything special for birthdays. The waitress said the staff would sing ""Happy Birthday"" and give us a slice of Tiramisu. Fantastic. Except the staff failed to communicate again. It was supposed to be a surprise for my boyfriend. However, one staff member started approaching us and happily singing ""Happy Birthday."" Then, he stopped abruptly when he realized that nobody else was following suit. So much for a surprise. The rest of the staff then awkwardly tried to restart the singing and brought out the Tiramisu. Of course, the Tiramisu didn't even have a candle on it. Great. Well, at least the Tiramisu tasted great.",4,URWpOVK9fAmpQvntMa9LOQ

We took advantage of the Happy Hour drink specials and ordered the $2 margaritas to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.  We also grabbed the $5 appetizer specials and ordered the calamari.  Both were very good, although I prefer my calamari with a marinara sauce (they serve it with a sweet/spicy chili sauce).  For my entree, I ordered the La Torta, and I have to say that I was disappointed with it.  It's basically a grilled chicken sandwich with sliced avocado, but there was no seasoning to it--no salt, pepper, spice or anything. It was very bland.  The beans and rice that came with it were also kind of bland, so I smothered them with salsa.

The service was very prompt and courteous, and our food was delivered to our table promptly.  We really enjoyed the music soundtrack that was playing--a good mix of dance tunes on a great sound system--that was a big plus!  The ambiance was pretty cool, with a lot of leftover features from the former place (Bar Louie's), but now with a Baja vibe.

My first taste was their classic whoopie - moist chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream filling. This was super decadent. The cake was really moist and deeply chocolate. The fluffy filling was really sweet as well. It was so good; I knew I'd have to have more!

Upon my recent trip to The Union, I had to stop and get some whoopie pies. I purchased a plain vanilla, a sweet and salty (chocolate whoopie with caramel filling), and a coco-loco (chocolate whoopie with coconut filling). They come refrigerated, so I put them in the fridge when I got home. I would definitely recommend leaving them at room temperature before eating. I think they taste much better and the flavors really pop. When they are cold, it's harder to determine the flavors in the filling. Of the three I purchased, I really enjoyed to coco-loco. The coconut filling had shredded coconut and was really tasty!

I had a half leg wax and armpits, we started at 10:15am and I was out before 10:30am. The aesthetician was quick and thorough and friendly but not overly chatty. 

REALLY IMPORTANT POINT: they use a new stick every time they dip into the wax, which I was really happy about. Very hygienic. 

It was an above satisfactory experience! They are currently running a promotion and before tip both services together came to $28.95 before tip.

Food was good, service was bleh-OK...
For a place with $20+ entrees I would appreciate real chairs... 
We were already hungry when we arrived, after being seated it seemed it took like forever for our server to show up... the bread alone took more than 20 minutes... we asked for more and it took 10 more minutes, we asked for more and our server brought it sooner, it is just that she missed to drop it at our table and was chatting for like 5+minutes at a table nearby... while I knew for sure the basket on her hand was our bread. It was very frustrating.

Appetizer arrived at the same time as our food (big no-no in my book)...

On the plus side, someone else took really good care of us refiling our drinks.
Portions are big. Hubby  had the pollo ajillo (comes with white rice) and I had the Cuban dinner sampler. Hubby liked his dish, and I thought mine was good too. The pork is like carnitas, the chicken had this lemony broth that gave the rice/beans a really tasty flavor. The ropa vieja was not my favorite but was good as well.

For appetizer we had ordered the chorizo stuffed dates (datiles con chorizo)... oh well, I am yet to find out if Cuban chorizo is the same as the chorizo I know from Mexico, because I didn't taste anything other than bacon and dates. The appetizer was warm at best and am not even sure if the bacon was fully cooked. Usually for foods wrapped in bacon the bacon is really crispy and this was not the case. Of course, I am not an expert on Cuban food and even though the flavor of date and bacon was interesting, this was not exactly what we were expecting from the way the appetizer is described in the menu.

Needless to say, we won't be back...",1,z_tqPytGQF_tDw_buHKJcw
JXAMnijxRrW-jXHGvDJzzg,0,2016-06-17 14:15:29,0,NhQPyEE7-DHMjUoDulrRuw,"Our friend told us this CPK has just opened with a bigger menu and some newly reimagined dishes. We wanted an easy spot to get brunch before our long drive back to LA, and this fit the bill. We walked into a massive spot, with mostly empty tables around noon on Sunday. There's outdoor and indoor seating, but with summer temps in Vegas, indoor makes a lot more sense. It's an open-concept kitchen and the inside of the place feels nice and open, but nothing remarkable.

Positives
+They had a whole menu of some non-alcoholic cocktails for $3. That price is spectacular!
+Our friend got the sangria flight (generous servings), which was also well-priced, and each one looked truly unique. 
+Menu is big and well-marked (vegetarian), etc. There's something for everyone.
+Service was excellent. Our water was attentive, friendly and very funny. Water and drinks were consistently refilled.
+Water is served with a lemon automatically - it's the little things!
+Pizza is extremely thin crust and has LOTS of veggies on the veggie pizza. This shouldn't be a surprise, but many places skimp.
+It only costs $1 to add an egg to a pizza.
+Roasted veggie salad had a good variety of veggies (artichokes, sundried tomatoes, olives, etc.). Negative is there was still A LOT of lettuce.

Negatives
-Guacamole was VERY small and more like a bit of diced avocado.
-It's still CPK. The menu, while seeming a bit bigger than other CPKs, was still pretty standard CPK. We left full and satisfied, but it is still a chain.
-Location is a bit remote in terms of other things on the strip. You need to seek this out a bit more.
-Parking situation, while not hard, does cost money and is a slight walk.

Positives far outweigh negatives, so it's worth a stop for something less lavish and still satisfying.",1,a923ofqpLwcfneeNeNTJ4g

HONG KONG STYLE CHOW MEIN. YOU MUST TRY! Believe me, every legit Chinese restaurant, even in Chinatown MUST have this dish. Most Americanized Chinese takeout places, even Panda Express and PF Changs DON'T have this dish. Even some Chinese restaurants in San Francisco don't have this dish. But here it's featured, and it's a must try. By far my favorite food. Sure you could drive to our Chinatown in Vegas but this place is so convenient for us here in North Las Vegas.

The Seafood Chow Fun and House Special Fried Rice had shrimps the size of large prawns!

And don't even get me started on the service, it's not your standard takeout place, they'll serve you so well. And this is straight from the humble owner.

I should've listened to my Grandma who's been coming here for months since there grand opening. They remembered her and even brought her complimentary egg rolls for keep coming back!

They even had a wide selection including boba - and I have to say that you won't find a place with this quality, variety, cleanliness, and service for miles! 

I hope this place stays here and becomes a staple!

Now, I've had pizza in Italy and Cibo isn't as good as that, however, it is some of the best I've had since Italy and was reminiscent of what I've had there. We came here on Wednesday night and the patio was packed and since we were pretty hungry we decided to not wait and just sit inside. I gotta say, it's a very cute place. I loved the decor, it felt very quaint and homey. The service wasn't the greatest, as our waiter was rather short with us and not too friendly.  The dessert did take a long time to get to us, but really we weren't too bothered by these things as the overall experience was a positive one.

Now, down to the good stuff... the food. My Husband and I shared a margherita pizza and a spicy salami white pizza. The margherita was to die for and the spicy salami was great with a nice kick. My favorite part of their pizza is the crust. It's is so flavorful and has great chewy and crispy texture. My sister had the special gnocchi, which was really good too. At the end we all shared the nutella and marscapone crepe, which was utter bliss. 

The prices were good, the food was awesome, the ambiance was delightful... we'll be back!",0,b3DYIU3TFc4gy9H_50_hUA

People post positive reviews here, and that's great. However, here's my rather different experience. 

Went to one artist, who loves Star Trek and has a bald head. Should I say his name or is that too much? Ok. I'll say his name. Smitty... He was supposed to do the tat in ONE sitting for a set price. He finishes apx 1/2, then tells me that I have to come back and pay more. This didn't bother me because he did such a great job (THE FIRST TIME ONLY, it turns out). The (first) tattoo is asymmetrical, jetted out on the edges, is supposed to look like a pattern coming out of the skin. It's a very specific concept and design, and there really is no mystery to what it is or isn't.

When I go back to get the piece completed, he had TWO things:

1) the original print out of the concept/design right next to him 
2) the piece that HE HIMSELF did on the front of my foot/ankle!

On the second visit, the piece was done as I lay on my stomach, on the back of my ankle/leg, outside of my vision. If I could have seen what he was doing, and knew the direction that he was going in, I definitely would have said something to halt the process or switch directions.

The second sitting looks absolutely nothing like the first! ITS UGLY. It looks like a blob, a block. The pattern is simply crammed together thoughtlessly in a blocked blob. It's like he paid attention to detail/design the first time, and the second time he didn't give a flying flick... It's not a lack of competency, it's a lack of thought and it's carelessness. Rushed, only thinking about the dollar perhaps? But with all the work that I'm going to end up getting, it's best to be long term greedy and actually care about the consistency of the design. 

I ended up paying 166% of the original quoted price, PLUS tip, for the reason stated in the 3rd paragraph/segment... so why not take time to care? It's not like I'm not paying you or tipping you. It's not like you've seen me act like uber B__ch, like how I feel like acting now! It's not like I wasn't polite or cordial at the time... Why put something rushed thoughtless and ugly, that looks absolutely nothing like the first beautiful piece, when it was supposed to be an extension of the first?

If there are 20 ways to do one thing, don't take the quickest, most basic, easiest, (and in this case, ugliest) route without checking with the person who has to end up dealing with it. If there's some confusion on the artist's part, it's best to ask what the client wants. If I knew I had to micromanage, I gladly would have done so. As stated above, HE HAD NOT ONE, BUT TWO SPECIFIC IMAGES TO WORK FROM. TWO! 

It's costly and time consuming to get a tattoo removed. Not only does it hurt like a mother-f when getting laser on a bone, but it costs $$$, and you have to wait maybe 6 weeks (?) between laser treatments. So it's months worth of time, more money, and needless pain.

Am I pissed the f off? Yes! If it was an easy repair, I wouldn't be as mad. But it's literally a block/blob, instead of skin showing within the design and this very specific concept. I've been staring at it, trying to figure out a way how to morph it into something else or make it look not so UGLY, and I can't come up with anything except removal. 

Tattoos are supposed to be beautiful. Its art. And if you use your look for your business, have to get a photo shoot done, whatever the case may be, it's even more infuriating. People don't know what media work a person may do, or what publications that they're in... nor do they need to know.... so why assume that the look doesn't have a high level of value IN A BUSINESS/ PROFESSIONAL SENSE??? If you're paying money, the work should be treated like it's going to be showcased in a high level magazine. Not treated like you're going to settle for less, or have no taste. It's tasteless. It's like walking into a poorly designed room with old raggedly furniture. In contrast to a room sleek and modern, with high attention to detail. 

I could write 5 books on this. I could post pictures too. But I'm going to leave it at that. I'll wait for it heal, get it removed, and find a more fitting appropriate artist to work on this long list of tats to add to my current 8. If I was a child or ghetto, maybe this work would be ok. However, I'm neither.",1,Fn0IAeYr3W_CaoF6rGXuEg

Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it
Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. 

There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. 

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it.

Whether or not you are familiar with the rampant insurance fraud by glass companies in Arizona or not you are paying extra each month on your insurance premiums even if you have never made a glass claim. Insurance companies have to pay extra so they can give you the money, gift card or tickets they promised you. 

So anyway I recommend Safelite to my 1400 clients because they provide quality glass for the appropriate price and provide high level professionalism and customer service.  More importantly Safelite is a huge supporter of our community here in Arizona and Scottsdale and are always willing to help.  Lastly something I take very seriously and the main reason I work with Safelite is not for the 99% of customers that go perfect it is for the 1% of the time there are bumps in the road or mistakes happen they stand behind their work 100%.

google and they sent someone out to help. Poor guys came in and out atleast 4 times because he didn't really know what he was doing. I wonder if they poorly train their associates? In hindsight, I wish I would've just went inside to get my pizza.

Finally! Food is out and I'm on my way back to the hotel! Pizza was good, I like the sauce but it was pretty dry. I was super underwhelmed and felt like I went through this silly process for mediocre pizza. ""Meh"" is my overall reaction.",1,u5o3NBQ3yXE1HXq5pmIEAQ

While we were looking over our menus we overheard a server commenting on the pumpkin cheesecake being house-made and amazing.  It got my hopes up that everything else would have been house made as well. 
I ordered the gnocchi, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. They both had the same sauce- which tasted like a can of tomato sauce with garlic powder and dried oregano sprinkled in before being served. Canned tomato products definitely have a distinct, awful taste so that was unfortunate.  The Gnocchi was stuffed with a spinach ricotta mix. They were kind of gummy, and were all extremely uniform.  
The chicken was breaded with Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and was more soggy than crisp. 
My boyfriend did like the bread they served before the entrees, it was like thickly rolled out pizza crust dough, brushed with butter and Italian seasonings, then cut into strips.  Our server poured a ton of oil and vinegar on a plate to go with it, I was surprised she used so much until I tasted it. It tastes like they either cut it with vegetable oil, or use an extremely low grade olive oil. The balsamic vinegar was very sweet and thin.
On the plus side, their wine was reasonably priced. They seem to stock the mass produced brands that most people are familiar with.",1,PumPDBmrhuV1NIyq9-Lk2A

Fist off, let me just say that I am a server so I understand when places are understaffed or the food comes out not to your liking.

First off we sat down at the bar because the wait was pretty long (expected that because it's a Friday night). When we got up there, the bartender seemed extremely frazzled. 
I asked for the campfire drink and asked if it had gluten and responded no. Got the drink and it had graham cracker all over the rim! I have the celiac disease and they should know what gluten is!!!! 
He seemed really annoyed that he had to make the drink in the first place but then I told him I couldn't have it and seemed extremely irritated. 

Took our food order and the food was DISGUSTING! Especially for how much it costs. While we sat there, we heard three other people send back their food. 

While we were eating nobody asked us how it was. There were three bartenders and nobody could keep track of who paid or ordered.

Made purchase & scheduled appt before 4/20 sale for my 2017 Chevy impala. Scheduled appt 1030 am. Was told I had to reschedule the day I show up which was 30 min earlier due to them being overbooked because of sale. My car was completed by 11 PM that night. 

Issues with battery because they eventually after 3 visits agreed remote wire was installed incorrectly. Issues with window tint. Back window cut to short. Both driver and passenger side had bubbles. & back side windows had dirt and noticeable leaves. Worse on driver side. Front speakers went out in less than a month. 

With 3 visits in attempt to resolve the issues there was a miscommunication with both reps at shop and the manager Stephan. I was told to reschedule each time. And not not one of the many things promised was not done due to Stephan not communicating properly with the shop reps. I Was promised different things. Car was never rewired as promised for first visit which they would have then realized it was their fault. My battery would've never drained which they did eventually replace. Only 2 windows were redone out of All except front strip that were promised would be replaced. Front speakers out of all 3 visits were never checked. I now have huge gap by my ignition switch. My steering colum was not put on correctly and now it's being rubbed when turning right. I will have to address this issue on my own. Ray (another manager involved since 3rd visit) will now not do anything to rectify the matter because he already replaced the battery they needed to replace anyway. I have not yet heard back from Stephan and most likely will not. I d0 not recommend this place to anyone. After 4 visits 8 hrs drive time total.

I have had my blonde highlights done by Ina on and off for a few years. I was always very happy with the results, yet I was kept trying to look for a more reasonably priced place because it is very expensive indeed (in my case about $300 with the toner and blow dry, which is not included).

And so it was that a month before my wedding I went to a very reputable downtown salon (supposedly the best in to) to have my highlights done. To make a very long and painful story short, my hair was butchered, orange, brassy, horrible. I did actually cry...so I went to Ina, to see if she could do anything to fix it, and she did. It was a very, very! long process; she put in new highlights and once the foils were in brushed with darker dye the rest of my hair, strand my strand...the result was absolutely amazing.

The bottom line is: she is good. She knows what to mix to get an ashy shade, she knows what will match your skin tone, she knows how thick/ think the highlights should be, where they should be...so I have decided that I would rather have my hair highlighted twice a year rather than every 3 months, but go to Ina rather than hopelessly keep trying to find a colorist that knows what they are doing.",4,2QsIQuJC_c9IgE0QxOJwiw

If your one of those guys, like me, who would rather have a buffet of some decent food over a barely half-filled plate of some fancy schmancy stuff, you may not want to go to a seafood joint that's landlocked. I mean, let's be honest, a seafood buffet is where it's at, and to find one it can be somewhat difficult in the Charlotte area. However, at Steve's, there are some damn filling portions of decent food if I must say so myself. Seems they pride themselves on their deep fried dishes, but that was expected. They also have healthier seafood options.

Service was great. Waitress was very attentive to the needs of our table. Venue is fairly loud, d√©cor-wise, but adds to the feeling of being down at the beach. And what can be better than that?",10,vCYPAeCFE7W5tdn7fVtsBw

Booking at 3 person reservation still meant sitting at the bar, but like many reviews noted, this is not a bad thing because 1) you get to see the food prepared and 2) purse hooks and 3) amazing lighting for food pics. 

What we ordered:

Bamboo - cocktail off the main menu with melon liqueur and 1.5 oz alcohol. Delicious and light, but not much in terms of booze.
Chicken Karaage - fried chicken is always a keeper - juicy inside, crispy outside
Beef udon - we needed some carbs too - was ok, but not the highlight
Salmon and 7 friends - beautifully displayed, server mixes up the dish and eat with seaweed. Delicious and salmon was so fresh.
Black cod sushi - beautifully served, and yummy. Love the big portions
Grilled black cod - this came last and was sizzling off the plate. Sweet and delicate, HIGHLIGHT!
Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce.
Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.

Food, as always, was amazing. I'm just not a fan of the noise level - it was migraine level at some point and couldn't have a conversation with my friends. One of us was always shouting: ""...wait, WHAT??""

The store is so close to my house I can walk to it, and they have grocery staples, priced only slightly higher than the grocery store so it's helpful when I need to grab something quickly. Their meat case has a great selection. Anytime I buy something from the meat case and succeed in not burning it, I am impressed. 

My favorite item continues to be the burgundy steak sirloin. In the summer, we grill these, and in the winter, we put them in the oven at 400 for exactly 20 minutes. My kid really enjoys their cheddar wurst, which can really come in handy if you're suffering from lack of salt in your diet. 

They've got a decent selection of beer, wine, cheese and other local accoutrements which, again, is really handy since they're right down the street.

I don't really care for any of the items in the prepared meat case. They usually have ribs, cooked chicken and various side dishes (potato salad, pasta salad) in this case, and while none of these prepared items is particularly *good,* they are all adequate and helpful if you're looking for some extra calories to go with your meat.",0,Zxi1uZbS40s38yHWotcgaA

My last trip, I finally opted for the turkey burger and it was just as delicious - a rare feat indeed (the last time I found a turkey burger equal to a hamburger was at Delux).

The dish looked like someone had taken a huge dump on my plate and garnished it with ONE SLICE OF TOMATOE.. weird weird stuff..

What I got was a rocks glass of pure cognac which almost sent me in to a fit when I took a sip expecting a sweet taste to wash down the burnt coal I was eating, instead I got a mouth full of pure alcohol..

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that Groupon was offering a deal where $15 bought you $30 worth of lunch, so I knew it was time to try it out.

I brought my dad down to the restaurant, and the first thing we noticed was super-small amount of parking available for the restaurant. It looked as though there were only four spaces available, though I'm unsure if the two nearby parking garages and valet are solely available for the apartment building, or are also available for restaurant patrons. That's where the dissapointment ended with our visit.

We walked into the restaurant and were amazed at how nice it looked inside. It had that classic Vegas atmosphere, a little dark and elegantly dressed, though not TOO elegant.

We were seated by the bartender, and waited on by his wife, who were both charming and extremely friendly. 

Our waitor brought us some EXCELLENT bread and butter, as well as a complimentary lentil soup and Caeser Salad (sans Chicken), and everything was WONDERFUL.

We also ordered some Garlic Bread ($3.50) as an appetizer, and were really pleasently surprised. It was definently chock full of garlic, but had a nice blend of cheese and butter as well.

For our main course, my dad ordered the lasagna ($13) and I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese ($13), which were both AMAZING. I especially enjoyed the Bolognese because it was made with both beef and veal, which actually made it taste similar to Osso Bucco. Both of the plates were so large that we were stuffed sufficiently by the end of the meal, and neither of us needed to eat dessert or dinner that night.

The salad that came with it was basically all lettuce and a small amount of carrots and 4 tiny cucumber 1/4 slices. The peanut dressing was extremely runny. My husband got beef pho and enjoyed it, wasn't the best he's had but was acceptable. The food came out lightening fast, like less than 5 min which semi scares me.

The food was banging, and I'm all for ""all you can eat""! My friend and I ate our $14 dollars worth because that was the cost when they first opened, but the price rises up to $18 for dinner now. I wish they had to-go boxes for the food you didn't finish, but, the eat everything or pay for leftovers is a very unique way to be a memorable restaurant. I don't know if it's good or bad though. 

Our waitress, however, was not great at all. She lied about her name to us and got our orders mixed up with another table. She barely came to fill our drinks and when I told her that I wasn't aware of tuna being in a dish--my fault for not reading more thoroughly--she went ahead to berate me and question why I didn't like Tuna and how she was flabbergasted that I didn't like tuna. 

I love the idea of this restaurant and the fact it is kind of like Genki Sushi in Washington state except there's a flat-rate price, so I definitely wanted to rate five, but the waitress hindered my experience, just a smudge, or a big smudge.",4,uPFkB4hke8RaIADN6y8Ixw

The last time I saw prices like this in Vegas was in 1992 when I was 8.  Is this 1992?  No it's ELLIS ISLAND.  I must say though, that price is only for the playa's club members but the girls at my table were able to work their charm with the waiter and get us the discount anyway.  I'm sorry to say that the charm thing didn't work the next day when I came back with a group of 8 dudes, but the full price is just a couple bucks more and it's TOTALLY worth it.  Those ribs are some of the best I've ever had and the BBQ sauce is delicious.  They keep the ribs in this smoker all day and then just grill em up right when you order them.  They're delicious and just fall off the bone.  The chicken is cooked perfectly too, although the white meat can get a little dry if you don't eat it right away.  

Over the course of the two meals I had here I ate 1.5 chickens and a full rack of ribs, plus 2 containers of bbq sauce.

My wife and I had four courses and several glasses of wine in under an hour, not by choice.  The table next to us even sent back several of their courses because they were still eating prior courses.  Given the prices, this type of table turning is inexcusable, especially considering there were several open tables.  

The o toro shashimi and butterfish tataki are fantastic.  If you have never had fresh wasabi, be prepared to be blown away.  One of our courses, the chicken and leek robata was inedible.  Basically, it was burnt, flavorless chicken on a stick.  When the floor manager cleared our plates, we expressed that we didn't care for the dish and he simply looked at us like we were speaking another language.  One of our main dishes was the madagascar prawn.  Flavor was excellent, presentation was cool, but the prawn was totally overcooked.  We explained to our server that the prawn was overcooked and once again, nothing.

RV_NgH8wT1TuOs2qNt1WDg,0,2017-07-05 03:08:38,0,jlU9YzFKtjMyQao87pFOWw,"This is the best Massage Envy location I've been too. Not sure if ME has improved in customer service and making you feel very valued from 5-10 years ago, or if the Scottsdale and Thomas Rd location just happens to be pros at this kind of service. This location rocks!

I became a member about four months ago, and I have not regretted it. I've had all great massages by Carlos, Shiva and today by Luisana. I've purposely been trying out different folks just to see who fits me the best. While they have all been very good massages and there were things I really liked very much by each person - I must say that Luisana's massage and personality was outstanding for me. I can't wait to see her again in August - it's already booked. 

Today I also treated myself and my teenage daughter to facials with Kameron. Oh yes! This was outstanding too! It was soooo relaxing and included two masks and a fabulous massage on our hands, arms and shoulders. She extracted more blackheads than I thought I could have ever had. Plus, I loved her personality too boot!  

Now I'm torn between getting massages and facials regularly. I might have to just do both.

For Massage Envy in general, the only thing I would like better is if I booked for 60 or 90 minutes, I wish I would get exactly that amount of massage or facial time. They subtract 10 minutes for prep before and after. I suppose the employees need the time inbetween to walk people out, get them a cup of water, and then to clean up the room between sessions. Maybe even take a short and well-deserved break. I can see ending 5 minutes early for that, but when we're ready to start, it doesn't take 5-plus minutes to get undressed and on the table. They also take a few minutes to talk before leaving the room to ensure they know what is desired. Today when I got on that table I thought that Luisana might be in the hallway, right there waiting for me, so I said, ""I'm ready"" loud enough for her to hear. It's the first time I thought to do this. She came right in, said, ""that was fast"" in her friendly tone, and got to work. Loved it. I've had others who seemed to be gone quite a while before coming back in the room while I got on the table.Not having a clock right there, I really couldn't say for sure.  

Before I end, I must compliment all of the front desk staff as well. After experiencing this location four times and interacting with quite a few of the staff, I can honestly say everyone has treated me great; has made outstanding recommendations; and haven't been too high-pressure on sales. Just the right touch by everyone. Thanks for being such a welcoming place to come in and relax and feel very valued. The relaxation room is wonderful too. So soothing and the perfect place to sit and have a drink of water before getting back into the full sun and the traffic.",2,wN7jGqK_ZpB9KoYSAUyr0g

It used to be one of my favorite - albeit expensive - sandwich shops. I always get the Capistrami with extra cole slaw and today was no exception. But the changes weren't just with the food. The young man and young woman employees were ambivalent and a even a bit rude. It was 11am so well before the rush hour and there was only one other customer. The young man took my order with not even a smile, barely whispered the cost which I had to ask him to repeat, which he did with a roll of his eyes. He didn't hand me my receipt, just walked away. The young woman who cooked and made the sandwich was fast - and that's really the only good thing about my visit - it didn't take very long. She called out my order and when I picked it up I smiled and said thanks, and she looked back at me blankly. It was just weird, I don't understand how customer service businesses can survive with such a lack of basic courtesy. Oh well, as long as the food's great...right? Not! Now keep in mind, for a few years I've ordered the Capistrami almost every time (once in a while I'll get the Bobbi) so I know what it's supposed to look and taste like. But it seems like the ""family recipe"" that never changes...has changed...and not for the better. What little corned beef was on the sandwich was gristly and chewy. I asked for extra cole slaw as I always do, and she really put on extra cole slaw...but she put it in place of the normal amount of meat. There was a small pile in the middle of the bun, seriously with absolutely no meat at the ends. I had to open it, dig around and spread the small portion of corned beef around. So really, I had a cole slaw sandwich with a little corned beef. Definitely not worth $9. So very disappointed. Worst sandwich and service I've ever had at Capriotti's. And if this was my first time here, I would rank them below Subway. Next time I'll go back to WhichWich, they have virtually the same sandwich, for the same price, and it's 10 times better...oh, and the WhichWich employees are actually happy to see you and glad you came in.",3,4N8f9JeFFtF3wOYiaWFNKQ

And they even brought out a birthday pastry and lit candle for the bachelorette (also the birthday girl) at the end of our meal.  

We were staying at the Cosmopolitan hotel during the weekend of the pool fire there and we got a $600 voucher between our 3 rooms, so we used the voucher to cover our meal here.  It did cover our meal but we weren't told until the next day when we were checking out that our voucher would not cover our tip, as we were led to believe.  No one at the restaurant told us otherwise. That was a bit deceptive.  

The food itself was so-so.  It was overpriced, came in very small portions, and was not the most fresh (considering how much it cost).  I've had better sushi elsewhere that hasn't been that overpriced. Maybe if I visited on date night with my fianc√© it would make more sense because we could order a sushi boat and be full. But split 13 ways, that meal did not make sense.  I shared my order with 2 other people - we ordered the Braised Short Rib (tasty and melted in your mouth but definitely too small of a portion), the Tuna Tataki  (definitely the highlight for me, but again too small a portion), and the Salmon appetizer (not the most fresh I've tasted).  Those 3 things came out to $90 and were hardly filling!  

I would likely skip Blue Ribbon in the future.  I'm willing to dish out a pretty penny for good food, but only if I'm going to get my money's worth. I didn't feel like we did at Blue Ribbon.",2,kKTcYPz47sCDH1_ylnE4ZQ

I found the seafood gumbo nothing special but good enough. I had some ravioli and it was a bit on the salty side but also OK. The creme brulee was a bit too sweet. The top was torched a bit too thick and thus making it too sweet. Its usually expected for these kinds of places.

A few colleagues and I headed here for an early lunch on a sunny day and got to sit on their patio that overlooks Stephen Ave. I've actually never sat on the patio before so I was excited to people watch and enjoy some delicious food.

I went with my favorite - Scallop and Prawn fettuccini without chorizo. The garlic butter sauce is sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan and red chilies to give it a nice kick. And the scallops and prawns are cooked perfectly as are the noodles.

The hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd down Stephen Ave is really fun to watch and being able to see from a different angle was awesome. Since the patio is narrow, you're sitting like you would at a bar so if it works well if you're with another person or two but it's probably not ideal for a big group. 

Another tip - since you're sitting up higher and the railing doesn't provide much shielding so be careful if you're wearing a dress/skirt or else you'll give the people below a glimpse of your underoos lol",3,eoiL_d6CH84T2rnYAM0_uA

My experience was similar to April's.  This place definitely has kinks, although, I think they've been open 3 or 4 months, so I'd have hoped the kinks had been worked out.

I went it at noon on a Sunday and it was pretty slow, about 1/4 full, mostly with families with kids.  The place was all ""just a tich"" out of place...tables and chairs out of place, the floors were a mess with crumbs, toast crusts, napkins, etc.  The counter staff seemed a little frazzled.  I saw 6-7 different people running food, from the bus boy to the counter lady, to the pastry chef and the manager.  Everything seemed just a little a miss.

My sandwich, the Grilled chicken procsiutto was pretty good, but I'd sub a different bread next time -- it was a 9 grain ciabatta that didn't fit with the tastes of the sandwich.  You can sub a salad for fries for 97 cents, which I dig.  

Overall, a weird experience...I was hoping for more.  The Esplanade needs a casual, quick, inexpensive option for grabbing a quick bite before or after a show.

Went and asked about the ""spa pedicure"" that was listed at $27. I confirmed the price with the woman that greeted me and she said~ yes $27 spa pedicure. The price was compatible to prices at other salons I'd been to, so I went for it. Keeping in mind I was a new walk in client, I wasn't sure what to expect but was hopeful. 

First off the massage chair was having issues. The woman was kind enough to fiddle with it a few times & get it to work, which was awesome. The actual pedicure itself was good. Nothing spectacular, but good. I was pleased, at the time being. The girl doing the pedicure barely said a word to me, but that's totally ok as I was relaxed and enjoying the pampering. 

Now I'd had spa pedicures before at the price range of $25-$30 and they included the usual foot treatments, polish, paraffin.... All in the spa pedicure. Since there usually isn't a breakdown of the service on the price list, you assume you're getting what you pay for right? Well I was clearly wrong.... Instead of $27 plus Tax for the spa pedicure ($30.51) it somehow came to $42.75. Clearly I was confused at the price, only to be told EXTRAS COST EXTRA. Ummm what extras? And why wasn't I told IN ADVANCE that this particular portion was an extra, so I had the option of agreeing to it, or saying no thanks. That's what bothers me, that they did NOT give me an option, nor did they even tell me prior to starting and even during... That it would be an additional cost. That made me feel SCAMMED big time!!!!  I told the woman I'd only agreed to the $27 spa pedicure and even asked her the price before starting. That this extra cost wasn't something I agreed to. She stood there silent waiting for me to pay, so not like I had a choice obviously. I left very annoyed and despite the actual pedicure itself being good, I'd NEVER go back again!!!! 

BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE not telling a new client, that was obviously unfamiliar with services at this salon!!! All it would have taken, was to let me know in advance that this (particular service) was at an additional cost. That's not too much to ask at all!!  Shame I had to give a one star rating, I'd prefer no stars if that was an option!!!

On one hand, the fish taco was amazing, but the regular soft tacos were less than appealing. Not to mention, the 35 min wait which you'd hope that the reward would be an amazing meal, but we were less than satisfied. 

It's located at Baldwin and Augusta, on the upper floor. There's a few picnic tables for communal eating and a window seating for people watching. There's also a piano for decoration but seems to not really play any other function - could fit more seats. 

As we were waiting there, it was quite noticeable that there was no sense of excitement or energy. It could be that it's that the majority of people were just waiting for their meals. 

If you're not savvy with Mexican food, all the names might be overwhelming, but the staff there are nice and are patient enough to explain them to you.

You have your tacos (a soft tortilla) or ""soft tacos"" (smaller $6 for 2) with a corn tortilla.  You can also make any one of these flavours a burrito - chicken, beef barbacoa, pork, veggie.  There's also empanadas and tostadas with creviche. Also Tamales (which I've never tried before til today) among other things. 

They also have gluten free shells for all of their tacos, so I requested it, but they just plain forgot when it finally came time to make my meal (at least 20-30 mins later) 

We ordered the fish taco, which was filled with some sort of coleslaw, cream sauce and guac. Aside from the fact the tortilla was not crispy and the entire thing ended up being soggy (waiting for 10 mins while my friend's taco was being prepared) - it was very tasty. 

We also got two soft tacos, double wrapped in tortilla (not sure why) which ended up with a filling vs shell ratio that was less than desired.  The filling inside wasn't hot either, and tasted a little bland over all. 

We also got a tamale, more out of curiosity.  It was wrapped in a Banana Leaf, then steamed (then microwaved to heat up before giving it to us). I quite liked it, but not sure if you can call it a speciality. 

Let's cut them some slack, because they just opened, and still trying to figure things out, but unfortunately the food isn't up to a certain standard either.",4,0BBUmH7Krcax1RZgbH4fSA

The lobby of this place looks much like a small train station, it was really busy with lots of people running around and a dark lighting or the area (and nowhere to sit down). The check-in staff were reasonably good and upgraded us to a nicer room on a higher floor (15th floor). The hotel is gigantic with something like 3 or 4 sets of elevators, so finding our room was a bit of a challenge. When we got to our room however, the cleaning staff was still in the process of cleaning. We went downstairs to see if we can get a difference room. The front desk was good at correcting their mistake and gave us another room on the 12th floor (after spending 15mins on the computer and phone) but to make up for the poor planning on their part we got 2 days of complimentary parking (which is $29 a day...)

The room itself is just so-so, the carpet is old and the washroom is small (but relatively clean). The beds were comfortable, however, it was very weird walking into the room and the first thing you see is little lumps on your bed...(the lumps were just from the comforter, which was naturally shaped that way...weird) We did have a gigantic 43"" LG flat screen tv in the room, but unfortunately, there is no wireless internet in the rooms and wired is something like $14 a day. I was told that there is free wifi in the lobby, but never got a chance to use it.

Overall, the Delta Chelsea is just another hotel where you can spend the night, but it is located in a really busy and active location in Toronto (on Gerrard just off or Yonge) although at night, it was still very quiet in the room.",0,XqWiDEMPFDZcbF4exyre8A

I got a large 3 topping hand tossed pizza.  Crust was crappy, sauce was crappy, and toppings were OK but sparse.  I would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza.  I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.  The only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food. But that is about it.",2,v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw

First, I discover this morning that Benkovitz Seafoods has gone out of business after over a century. 

After arriving home from work this evening, I called Krazy Brothers to order pizza and instead got Vinny's of Brookline!

According to the fellow who delivered the pizza and hoagie to our house, Krazy Brothers sold their phone number to Vinny's. So if you call the listed number from Krazy Brothers, you'll now get Vinny's. 

 Krazy Brothers was one of my 2 favorite pizza outlets in Brookline, the other being DeMino's, and it too is empty.

I had a sinking feeling that KB was done when I noticed that the storefront was unoccupied the last few times I rode past it. 

It shoulda been Vinny's. For shame.",10,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A

They have one of those conveyor belts for the sushi if you sit at the bar.  We took a table and ordered off the menu.  We both got bento boxes.

First came the miso soup.  It had a strong flavor, and was salty.  Not my favorite.

The chicken Katsu in the bento was pretty good.  The teriyaki chicken had a sort of charred taste to it.  I didn't really like it.  The ""steak"" strips were almost flavorless.  Yes, they tasted like beef but very weakly.  Kinda strange.  I didn't try the cucumber salad stuff.  My wife likes that sort of thing so I gave it to her.  She seemed to like it.  I did eat the sushi pieces that were included.  Very little flavor there also.  The calamari salad was a pile of calamari on top of a pile of leaves (spinach, I think).  The calamari was cooked properly, not too tough or chewy, and the flavor was fine.

So overall:  underwhelming.  Not bad, but nothing to get excited about either.  There are some better options out there for sushi and for general Japanese food.",0,YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw

I think it might've been their private dining room but none the less we were stuck in a mute, dark, non decor area. The restaurant part was very open and beautiful which we weren't able to enjoy ‚Äç.
The food was ok  but nothing that really blew me out of the water. We ordered a dozen oysters, truffle sashimi, ny strip steak, king crab, lobster mash, Brussels, gnocchi, and coconut dessert. Our waiter forgot the gnocchi due to miscommunication ‚Äç they also forgot to give us chopsticks for the sushi and didn't give us a drop plate or bucket to put our king crab shells in. Had to ask for all these and when they cleaned our table after we were done with our main before dessert they didn't replace our napkins. They also don't have steamed towelettes for cleaning your hands after the crab which is a bit bizarre.

We came in on a slow weekday night and stepped into the line not knowing what to order. We were told to share a 3 meat plate that came with 2 sides (and an extra if you check in on yelp) and bread.

Ordered: Pulled Pork, Tri-tip brisket and baby back ribs ($5 extra due to half slab). On the side we chose Mac n cheese, beans and fries. 

The sauce made the meal, and pretty much stole the show for me. The meat wasn't the tastiest as far as bbq joints went and I regret buying such large portions. I know they dry rub their meat, but it comes off too dry and I have to dump sauce to flavor it. 

Tables are picnic tables and napkins are paper towels located at each table, along with their sauces. If you want some heat, you can ask for some of their hot sauce. 

Service was the one great thing. Natalia knew her meats and was incredibly accommodating and patient while we chose what to order. Everyone else from the cashier to what I believe to be a manager, was kind and welcoming.

When it changed to Planet Hollywood, I ate here for a family reunion dinner and it was decent, it was better back then.  So, we tried it out once more during our most recent adventure to Vegas.

First off, $27.99 per adult for dinner, on a Monday?  That's Redonkulous with a capital ""R.""  Thankfully, I'm not complaining much because I got a BOGO coupon so technically, for the s/o and I, it was only $14 each.

The buffet offerings were just okay.  Sure, they had crab salad and shrimp cocktail served in martini glasses but don't be fooled by it, it's not better quality, it's called perception.  They also had the usual Asian, Italian, American, Mediterranean and Seafood fare.  BTW, is it just me or do my fellow Asians act like savages when it comes to Crab Legs?  It's not like it's going to run out people, there's more where it came from, geez!  The salad bar, which was separated in opposite ends of the buffet had to be the sorriest salad bar I've ever experienced, even my hometown pizza parlor offers more salad toppings than this buffet!  But in the end, how can you be mad when they serve up fresh Cotton Candy?  Thankfully they put it high enough so the kiddies don't snatch it all up or get their cooties all over them. :)

Overall, if I had paid full price, The Spice Market Buffet would've gotten 2-stars, no doubt.  But since I didn't, in my opinion, it was worth 3-stars.

PS - Want a BOGO coupon too?  Just check in to Planet Hollywood on FourSquare, show your phone to the Rewards desk located near the bar and they'll give you your coupon.  Not sure how long this promo will last though.",2,-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ

Some places don't let you bring outside food in - so it was so great that they let us bring our own cake because it was custom made and beautiful. OHSO has the best mojitos I have ever had. They have a great atmosphere outside in the back which is where we were. The food is awesome. I would definitely make it a regular spot to eat and drink,0,Rj0GW_41ptQdGLIqj5cVlg

That being said after having breakfast here once I decided never to go back. Limited number of options (no cereal or cold healthy options) and expensive for what you get. Yes I know that everywhere in Vegas is expensive but you can get better value for money elsewhere.,0,aI-4lJchB5Zz4-5kIgHkKw

I rolled in with one eye open after spending 3 hours at the Art Museum and was on the border of passing out from a combination of exhaustion and starvation.  I was seated immediately and greeted by my server.  The decor here is pretty rustic, with huge planks of wood sticking out of the wall, giving it a cabin feel to the place.

I scoured the menu and couldn't decide what to get.  Part of the reason I rounded down is because I wasn't really impressed with their menu selection. I had a hard time deciding what to get, and finally went with a burger and fries.  Also, they only have home made pop here, nothing name brand.  (no coke or pepsi on tap.)

Even though the food was good, I LOVED my server.  She rocked it out and I really enjoyed her company.  I guess she's been there a long time, and I would go back just to sit in her section.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I was much happier with the service I received.

Overall, I had a good time here, and tried to go back in Friday night, but it was so packed i couldn't get seated, so I passed. I don't want to say I regret it, but I just didn't have the energy to wait.",6,qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ

I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio.  All the tables were quite dirty!  I understand that we were seated outside, however, I have eaten at other restaurants before where their patio seating is CLEAN...I guess it doesn't happen at this place.

Overlooking the dirtiness, I wanted to give Bootleggers an opportunity to prove my impression wrong through their food.  As the waitress came out, I saw that her uniform (which was black) was quite dirty also!  Her black apron and shirt was smeared with some red sauce (spaghetti maybe?) and white powder (cocaine maybe?)...Really not appetizing.  I did notice that the inside dining had very dim lighting, so maybe she didn't realize that her uniform was that dirty.  Nonetheless, it's not something I want to see.  

She took our drink orders and handed us the menus.  Even those were DIRTY!  A friend of mine had a coffee stain on his menu and we all had water/sauce stains throughout the pages....They should really clean those!  We should have left then and there, but NO!  I wanted to let Bootleggers redeem themselves through their food.

The waitress came back quickly with our drinks, complementary mini garlic rolls, and took our food order (she was quite friendly btw, which was a plus).  I had the mozzarella caprese and deep fried cheese ravioli.  

The garlic rolls were not really warm...well, let me take that back.  They were warm on the outside and cool on the inside.  Meh, let's say I wasn't a fan.  The mozzarella caprese and deep friend cheese ravioli were both were pretty good.  Nothing exciting or exceptional though.  The caprese needed more balsamic glaze.  They just squiggled three lines on the plate.  The cuts of mozzarella were nice and thick, so was the tomatoes.  The deep fried cheese raviolis came with marinara sauce.  There was a good crunch to them.  However, once again, these dished were forgettable...which is better than being bad dishes, I guess.

My hair was dry, split, and broken.  It was attracting hummiingbirds, who thought they might nest in it.   I did a bit of web research, and felt Christophe might have the kind of expert coloring and conditioning I was searching for.  

The salon is beautiful, a bit hidden in the back of the huge MGM hotel complex, and it overlooks the elaborate pool area.  The stations are sleek and clean, modernistically streamlined.  Sunlight flooded the stations, and made for a pleasant ambience.

I made an appointment with Jean-Marc at Christophe, and had a brief consultation when I arrived.  My colorist Paul, also consulted in great detail, to be sure of the effect I wanted.  I had gathered several pictures, since color is extremely hard to describe save visually, and also had a style discussion.  I wanted a bit of a trendy retro look, a slight bouffant, and believable honey blond streaks.  Paul proceeded to do the most precise job of streaking my hair that I have ever have.  I have long, normally strong straight hair, and he patiently streaked my entire mane.  He also touched up the brass at the roots, and did a marvelous conditioner, that made my hitherto straw locks look like silk.  The L'Oreal hair products I got to continue the condition have helped my hair heal.

Then I had the pleasure of Jean Marc creating a personal style appropriate to my yen for glamour, and busy lifestyle.  He quickly and masterfully rendered a long Bardot-inspired cut, which took advantage of my slight natural wave, and created a casual, yet suave look.  At $150.00 for the cut, it is a bargain.

When I left the salon, I was walking on air, my newly blown-dry mane signaling the resurection of a devoted fashionista.

Merci mille fois to both Paul and Jean-Marc!",3,ID7ccpPgEZ-BdqO0lSFqnQ

ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,2,2018-06-27 10:30:32,3,vlmRBCJekyfCcKv39qH1Qg,"Not a fan of Restaurant Week, the opinion that a donation can be made to one's favorite charity anonymously without suffering a plug and chug menu for the masses apparently uncommon in modern society, it was largely a result of longtime curiosity that led to dinner at The House of Blues Foundation Room on Saturday night.

Famously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.

One of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a ""guest-list"" and/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.

Priced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.

Playing mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with ""Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side"" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's ""Jumbo"" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.  

Decidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, ""My Cousin Vinny"" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.

Excellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while ""fresh baked"" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as ""warmed-to-order,"" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar.",4,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

We each got pork belly ramen - from the Bay Area in California, I have pretty high expectations for ramen, but noodle texture was good and right on. 

Kim chee topping was not what you'd typically expect and not what I normally want with my ramen noodle and broth but since it's an Asian fusion restaurant, it was an interesting combo to try. Kim chee aside, the pork belly was crisp and bamboo shoots once soaked in the broth went well with the dish.

So MGM spent millions change the entrance and replace the open lion mouth with a regular bronze lion statue. 

  The rooms are nicely decorated and fairly modern looking. I am minusing a star for not having a plasma.A 42 inch plasma is a requisite in my estimation. The views of the strip were outstanding.The beds are the most comfortable from all the hotel casinos I have stayed at - Venetian, Luxor, Treasure Island, Hilton and Aladdin.  I must have slept for over 7 hours and I usually do not sleep for more than 5 hrs in Vegas. The bed definitely had something to do with that. 

  MGM is one of the nicer casinos to play at and they have some of the better restaurants - Fiamma, Shibuya, NobHill, Wolfgang Puck and L'Atelier Joel Robuchon.

 I used to rave that this was my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. 
NOT ANYMORE.

Perhaps my tastes have changed, maybe I have higher expectations for service...or this place has both bland and  poorly executed food, with bad/slow service to boot.

To start, I arrived with my significant other (who is a chef) at around 7 last night. There wasn't a hostess to greet us at the door. After waiting about 3-5 minutes someone came over to greet us while carrying a load of dirty dishes, walked passed us with them and set them down on the table behind us. Mind you I understand she was helping out, but there were less than 7 tables in the place and she could have set the dishes down first away from the host stand. But she sounded friendly enough, and took us to a table inside, in a room with only one large party placed in the middle (all other tables were empty). And sat us directly next to the party, next to the loudest section of that party, where we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone hear each other. I asked to move, and the hostess moved us only one table away but still DIRECTLY next to this loud party. I then asked to be moved further and she chose one more table away from that but STILL directly next to the party. Then I complained for the third time and the guy watering our table let us finally move across the room despite ALL of the empty tables in the place. 

So I try to start again fresh focusing on the menu. My guest orders bruschetta to start for the both of us. It arrives rather quickly. The bread is about the same as what was already on the table except instead it has a thin slice of Smoked tomato and a few pieces of ricotta cheese and is really hard being overly toasted. The taste was bland because there literally wasn't anything to the bruschetta besides a slice of tomato and ricotta cheese...NO Olive Oil (which it desperately needed because it was dry), and NO salt/cracked pepper (considering it was BLAND). the only saving grace was the slice of tomato and still we would have been better off with the free bread on the table because at least that came with butter so it wasn't completely dry and a value.

Next we received our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, which was pretty decent. I ordered the Braised Short Rib Gnocci dish which I have had at least 3 times.  But this time it was bland. It was supposed to have a Gorgonzola sauce. I could barely taste the cheese, there may have been a tiny hint of it according to my boyfriend (who didn't like it) and it needed salt. However, the short rib was cooked perfectly and there were plenty of the tasty mushrooms but I wished I had something with more flavor.

As for the service, it was slow and awkward. To start I had to request 3 times to be moved. Between the ""appetizer"" and Main Course my server took my B&B plate out of my hand while I was moving it closer to me and said ""thank you"" like I was handing it to her. She obviously misunderstood me, leaving me confused and stuck holding my silverware in my hands as I had nothing to set it on until I reached over and grabbed another small plate off the table next to us.  It was incredibly uncomfortable. The server also disappeared for a long time after we were finished with our meal. My boyfriend wanted to order dessert but decided against it due to the slow service, and chose to have dessert at Sweet Moses instead.

So at the end, all I enjoyed was the Blackberry and Mint cocktail, the decor and music. And my Boyfriend, the chef, said the only thing he enjoyed about dinner was dessert at Sweet Moses. They gave us excellent service, the coffee and sundaes we ordered were perfectly delicious, coffee was fresh, we liked it so much we even ordered a slice of apple pie and tipped out the staff enough that they weren't sure if it was a mistake or not.

All in all, if you are looking to have an exceptional meal while out on the town, I would pass on Luxe. But if you want Cocktails and atmosphere and maybe to share a few dishes (so you're not committed to just one in case it's bland) this could be the place for you.",1,_FafQqqr61rtC5SzsywkPQ

I asked the waitress what on the menu only contained seafood since I'm pescitarian, she answered with saying some fish dish. Later she served me the fish with a bowl of noodles and beef. After telling her I couldn't eat that she made a big fuss on changing my order even though I told her I didn't eat beef and said this was the last time I could change my order (even though it was the first time?).

My friend who was with me during this little encounter later told me that someone she came with before also got shit on by the servers for trying to change her order.

But honestly they don't even expect tips so what kind of service was I expecting?",1,-6tgOg17T1bsh-DHGht-QQ

Bang Bang shrimp, bread with a pesto dipping sauce, corn chowder with crab, Caesar salad with blackened shrimp, Maryland crab cakes, potatoes au gratin ... It was all very yummy (though admittedly a little heavy for lunch). I would definitely come back for the food. 

But the service was just meh. We had to ask for bread three times, and each time the excuse was ""we're waiting for it to come out of the oven."" Then why wasn't it hot when it finally came to the table? Toilet paper dispensers in the bathroom were mostly empty even though we were among the first customers of the day. And paying for the bill took forever. Granted, we threw them some curveballs with our coupons, but it still took entirely too long for them to tell us that the coupons wouldn't work and to process the bill. Manager also seemed a little rude and kept our coupon because he thought we were trying to scam the joint -- no, buddy, we were using a valid coupon that's worked at other locations, and it's never been a problem before. Don't appreciate the feeling that you're treating us like criminals when we also happen to be the only group of foreigners in the place.

I was stuck here on a layover to Florida. Landed at 9pm and was hoping to find some food to hold me over until my red-eye took off. To my surprise, nothing in my terminal was open. At 9pm? Are you kidding me. The only available food came from the duty free shops in other words cold sandwiches and a bunch of processed snacks. 

The terminal was outdated and dirty. Someone puked a few feet away from me while I was charging my phone in one of the lounge areas and it took over an hour for someone to come by and clean it up. The smell spread, I moved away to avoid the smell, but I could still smell it. 

I tried to take a nap since my flight wasn't until midnight, but the seats were uncomfortable and it was too packed for that.

Finally, I'm about to board and leave this horrible place, but the ticket scanner is out of service and they have to do this the caveman way. The process was so slow. I was ready to board my plane and get as far from Phoenix as possible.

I had the meatball sliders which were pretty good but they were really soggy. 

Our waitress only came by once after we were served our food which by then the chicken sandwich was cold.

I think this place has a lot of potential. It's super cute and decorated really cool. Because they recently opened maybe there are some kinks to work out. 

I was really surprised that we were not offered to have our check adjusted since my wife could not eat the chicken sandwich.

tcT3oHh_dwi_FYhozw3Ibw,5,2007-12-02 00:22:26,0,ChS2QDCuz3v0kXvenYxyYw,"There's something about places like Bomberos that turns me  into a 5-star-slut, I confess. I so much WANT this place to be cool because I want more and more of them to start popping up in Phoenix, that I'll give subconsciously 5 stars to anything that tries hard enough and looks like it's got the right stuff. 

That said, I also tend to give high reviews based on that intangible X factor that just comes with having a good time in a place with a cool vibe. That will usually happen in Bomberos, unless your company consists of a bunch of jerks, which it turns out the two fellow Yelpers I met here were not. 

Since I decided to stick with a known entity, Xingu and Quilmes beers (from Brazil and Argentina), I didn't have the same underwhelming vino issue Mr K did. I do agree that the bruschetta and cheeses were merely ""not bad"", and didn't blow me away. I loved the Brazilian band that gave us a musical backdrop. They played at the perfect volume despite being confined to a small space, so conversation remained unrestricted. One musician played his instrument seated on a shiny red Vespa that he wheeled into the place. The outdoor space definitely looks cool. The crowd was a mix of what seemed to be late 20somethings ranging up to 40somethings. 

The location is, I think, a harbinger of the future. Those of you who've been in the Valley for less than 2 years probably don't have an appreciation for how cool Central Avenue really is, or can be. It's been taken hostage by light rail construction, so it is best to be avoided and ignored until its liberation in the near future. But in its natural state, driving up Central from south to north has always been one of my joys of life in Phoenix. I used to drive up to the multi-million dollar neighborhoods past Bethany Home or so to go running along the shaded path on the side, along with dozens of other pedestrians, baby strollers, joggers, and dogs walking their humans. In the 1950s this entire region of north/central Phoenix was an irresponsible experiment in trying to use large green trees to beautify and cool down residential areas. The tree strategy was of course abandoned by planners who had the foresight to implement more pro-water conservationist policies elsewhere. But the remnants of that experiment remain, and they are comprised of the cool little neighborhoods up along Central Avenue. Bomberos, I think, is investing in what many believe will be a bright and charming future for this stretch of Central.",1,mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw

Restaurant had a rustic feel with an open kitchen concept. So you can see cooks at work. 

We ordered the bacon cheddar burger, grown up grilled cheese and the black and blue pancakes to share. We also had a flask (1L) mojito special. 

Bacon cheddar burger was VERY tasty with lots of flavours going on. The bacon was thick and cooked properly, not too crispy and not too chewy. The flavour of the bacon didn't overpower the rest of the burger either. There was also melted cheese, and pickles as well. The burger was juicy, and cooked just right, with the middle still pink (some may not like this). It was messy to eat but filled me up. I had the daily soup as the side which was the beef stew and it had tons of ingredients and big chunks of beef. It tasted homemade and warmed the soul. Overall the burger was oily but tasty. 3.5/5

My girlfriend ordered the grown up grilled cheese which is really just a grilled cheese with mushrooms, arugula and carmelized onions. It was okay, nothing special and not a must try. It was on the dry side and didn't have much flavour. The mushrooms overpowered everything. She got a salad as her side but she did not enjoy it as the dressing was also too oily. 3/5

Black and blue pancakes - they were the star of the meal. Blueberry topping was SOOOO good. Perfect amount of sweetness and blueberry taste. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and full of flavour. When we cut them open they were steaming. My girlfriend also loved the brown sugar butter. These are VERY good, comparable to a certain temple's pancakes. GET THIS to share!!! 4/5

The snowball mojito was served in a glass beaker but the mint and like were not muddled in properly so you couldn't really taste it. They also came with small beaker glasses with cinnamon sticks in them, we both removed them because it was very weird tasting and overpowering in the mojito. Presentation was good, taste was subpar. 2/5 

Overall this brunch place was an interesting visit and I would say it was worth it for the pancakes. We didd not have to wait, so I guess that added to it. May eventually try the dinner menu.",0,S174fBtIcnQFGH8Ngo861g

The live music was an added touch to the dining experience; loud enough that you could enjoy it, but quiet enough so that you could easily enjoy conversation with friends. 
They have a good food selection which is different than your normal bar food. Good smoked meats and a nice selection of side dishes. I had the sweat potato fries (the dipping sauce was amazing!), the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the slaw; all were great! 
The girls working were friendly and accommodating.  
There is a wide variety of drink selections available for someone who enjoys craft beer. I was with a friend who loves bourbon and he was in heaven.

That was what I was in the mood for the other day, when my lady and I went to the Diner Deluxe for dinner.
This casual 50's style diner has a warm, cozy feel to it - it's comforting.
But sadly, that comforting feeling didn't translate into comforting food.
I don't know what the opposite of comfort food is - I guess it'd be called ""distressing food"". 
And that's what the meals turned out to be - distressing.
We ordered the Chipotle Pulled Pork sandwich on ciabatta, and a Steelhead Trout sandwich with roasted potatoes and a side salad.
The ciabatta bread that held the pulled pork was great, but the pork itself had an odd cinnamon/curry flavour to it that I found distasteful.  The Steelhead trout sandwich was again on really good bread, but I didn't know that Steelhead trout meant ""salmon"".  I'm not a salmon fan, so I suppose I'm the one at fault for ordering it and not liking it.  But it's through no fault of my own that the roasted potatoes were giant, bland and mushy, and the side salad was basically lettuce with a runny bitter cream dressing.

I considered a two star review, just because I understand restaurants that are named after sports celebrities are usually selling a name and not quality, but Majerle's worked hard to earn one star, start to finish. 

We arrived to dirty tables.  Not only ours, but we were surprised to see other parties being seated at dirty tables.  This was during the first round of March Madness, and they really had a tough time figuring out what channels to find the multiple games.  Very slow service, which I rarely complain about. Started with the wings, which were pretty bad.  I've had much better from the frozen food aisle.  Keeping the tables clear and waters full was a challenge, but we were reassured by the server that she had asked the busser to do it, but the busser had not done it.  

Entrees were OK, but far from great.  We joked that when the server asked if how I wanted my steak sandwich cooked, she technically did not say that they would cook it that way, because my medium rare looked a lot like medium well.  

The most grievous sin happened later in the evening.  Lots of TVs were showing various sporting events, but the main TV (with sound) was set to a channel of a completed game, and they had moved on to the local news.  A crowded sports bar on a Saturday night, and for well over a half hour, the background noise and primary TV were set on local Arizona news.  Weather report, local crime report, local news puff piece.  Makes for a fun, sports bar atmosphere, no?  I'm not sure how such a thing goes on in a sports bar, especially during March Madness.  

The evening was topped off with a pretty horrible cookie/ice cream dessert.  I don't think it was really ice cream, but ice milk.  The cookie tasted more like a cookie cake.  Pretty bad.

I  found this hidden gem after my broker told me about them and I took my 8 week old puppy to them I just got with respiratory problems. I've been to 3 vets prior they kept telling me she'll be fine she just has a cold well Dr. Higgins did an X-ray on her and turned out she had pneumonia!!!! If I listened to those other vets my puppy would probably not have been able to survive. Thank you Dr. Higgins! now my puppy is healthy and just got her first set of shots from this hospital.

I called from Chandler and, as promised, a taxi was next to my door in 15 minutes.
A driver called when he arrived.
2. Minus one point for a car that smelled like an ashtray.
I mentioned the smell, and a taxi driver said that it should be smoke-free, but evidently, it was not the case with this car
3. Minus one point for getting from point A to point B by making a detour.
As soon as I noticed that we are driving on a street which was nowhere in my route, I questioned the driver why. We were supposed to take one street all the way to the destination - the fastest route. He replied that his navigation chose this route to avoid driving through Gilbert city (via Gilbert Rd). I understand they wanted to avoid extra lights, but because of it my mileage went up. I was supposed to pay around $23 (no traffic), but ended up with $30 ($35 after a tip) That's a big difference for such a short route.
4. One point for a convenience and decent driving.

Most likely, I will use them again, but next time I will make sure I know beforehand if they are planning on making any detours. Also, discountcab has a website where you can approximate your total and print out your route. If you want a piece of mind, you can just hand a print out to the driver and ask if this will be the route he/she takes.

8/23/12 Update 
A reputation of a taxi cab company depends on 1. dispatcher 2. taxi driver
I had to take Discount Cab again (after I got disappointed in  Clean Air Cab company where a driver wanted to overcharge me $12 because his navigation did not have South Power Rd and led him to North till he noticed & adjusted the route... yeah, right)
I had  Schumacher as a driver, but I did not mind it because this guy knew what he was doing. Some people get into accidents driving 30mph so driving fast does not always = dangerous. The fare at the end of the trip was exactly what it was supposed to be - $33 (+$7 tip because I was happy with everything)

Suggestion to Discount Cab - put an ID tag with a driver info in front of passengers and encourage them to rate all drivers at the end of the trip. Everyone has smart phones; utilize it, and fire all drivers who get certain number of complains. If you want to be fancy, you can have a bar code assigned to each driver so it can be easily scanned.

I will give 1 star back when I consistently get drivers who do not try to scam me by blaming navigation (seems to be a common thing nowadays)",2,nZ6OGzoZVyChxbeTcD1Rqw

Par confort, j'ai opt√© pour des bouchons d'oreilles et cela a suffi √† rendre mes nuits plus silencieuses ( √† 4$ les 5 paires, l'investissement n'√©tait pas ruineux).
L'acc√®s est tr√®s facile : le bus de l'a√©roport et le m√©tro arrivent √† un bloc de distance (mais pas le m√™me :-) ). 

En arrivant √† pied √† l'h√¥tel, vous aurez peut-√™tre remarqu√© quelques th√©√¢tres pour adultes. Il y a effectivement quelques m√®tres de trottoirs consacr√©es aux plus de 18 ans, et le voisinage de l'h√¥tel ne fait pas exception. Cependant, il n'y a rien de malsain dans cet entourage : apr√®s tout, on est au c≈ìur de la ville.

La r√©ception est situ√©e au premier √©tage, escalier obligatoire. Nous avons √©t√© tr√®s bien accueillis avec un enregistrement rapide assorti de nombreux conseils et de la documentation indispensable pour commencer notre s√©jour.
Nous avions opt√© pour une chambre √©conomique avec salle de douche commune. La surface modeste de la chambre √©tait compens√©e par un haut plafond et un grand placard, nous n'√©tions donc pas encombr√©s par nos bagages. 

Il y avait 3 salles de douche pour l'√©tage. Elles √©taient nettoy√©es plusieurs fois dans la journ√©e et je ne me suis jamais retrouv√©e √† attendre. Ce n'est qu'√† de rares occasions que j'ai trouv√© des traces indiquant le passage d'autres h√¥tes, alors m√™me que l'h√¥tel √©tait plein.
Le wifi ne passe pas tr√®s bien dans les √©tages. Comme la chambre √©tait juste au-dessus de la r√©ception, nous avons pu en profiter. Autrement, les fauteuils de la r√©ception vous accueilleront pour votre surf.
Pour le petit d√©jeuner, je crois que l'h√¥tel a un accord avec un restaurant tout proche. De notre c√¥t√©, nous avons pr√©f√©r√© profiter des nombreux caf√©s de Montr√©al.

En conclusion, si vous recherchez le silence et le design, vous serez certainement frustr√©s.

The facilities are clean, the people are polite, and the prices are reasonable. Or at least for the particular issue my dog was having. If it's your first visit, you'll receive half-off the exam fee. We experienced no pressure when we declined some of the recommendations they suggested. Everyone on staff is very professional.

My chihuahua hates going to the vet and can immediately recognize that he's at one based on the smell alone. Fortunately, the doctor who was assigned to us (Dr. Stockmann) and staff were all very patient and understanding. We were prescribed the appropriate medication for his eye irritation, as well as the usual instructions on how to apply.

We ended up returning to them several weeks later when my girlfriend's rescue chihuahua had to have a great deal of his teeth removed due to decay problems. The price was on par with most other vets, with the exception of the universities, of course. Their hours and availability resulted in her choosing them over a few cheaper alternatives. Her little dog was well taken care of before, during, and after the procedure with no complications to note.

What I really like about this place, however, is the fact that they allow payment plans without going through a credit company. This is extremely helpful if a situation arises where the procedure would be a big financial blow otherwise.

Honestly, no one really wants to take their dog to the vet. And the less I have to take my dog there, the better off things are. But if the situation calls for it, I would definitely use them again.

Then she lowered the recliner a little, put a pillow on my lower back and told me to relax. She massage my shoulders, neck, ears, head & then face with plumeria lotion. She lowered the recliner all the way, to where it was flat. She informed me it was optional to remove clothing before back massage. Then I laid flat on my tummy. She massage my shoulders and neck more & massage my entire back, glutes, & asked if I wanted my back walked on (heck yes!!..as I whispered ""just don't break me""). She was a small lady and the walk felt great. Then she massaged my arms, hands and legs. She asked if I wanted hot stones for $4 (of course!). OMG! Amazing!!!

I've been a big fan of Bahama Buck's for years, so when this location opened in Gilbert, my wife and I were pretty excited. It's got everything you want from a BB location: A fun lively interior, loads of delicious flavors, and a drive thru. 

My favorite flavor combinations are blue coconut/pina colada, root beer/birthday cake, or Coca-Cola with just about anything. 

Make sure you get a punch card, because once you start going it's easy to rack up the punches quickly. Certain occasions will even warrant double punches, like particularly cold days or certain months of the year (right now is a July double punch promo for BRMs). 

BB is great for a refreshment on a hot day. A place to meet friends. Bring your kids because there's something for any age (literally, they have a kids plain shaved ice).

They took the time to research and find the cab and driver using our credit card information. They did a full investigation and although I don't know if the driver got reprimanded, they were very diligent in the follow up process. I guess I would take an Ace Cab again, but next time I'll double check to be sure I don't leave anything behind.

EDITED: Below is my initial post. One day after posting I was contacted by the parent company and they are looking into the situation. I appreciate their effort and I will let everyone know if anything comes of it.

ORIGINAL POST: Driver was rude and a thief!!! We left our ipad in the car and so I left a message on their lost and found number and never got a response. However, we got a call today from a guy who bought the ipad from the taxi driver. Sounds like a scam, but no matter how it went down the driver did NOT turn in the ipad and the company never got back to me. I understand Ace is one of many cab companies ran by one parent company. I would (& will) avoid them all if this is how they conduct business. At least follow up. I realize it's difficult to monitor all the drivers, but at least pretend to care.",4,gYrOhGguJ22lhxs8IX8xvg

Don't go expecting tacos rolled up on piping hot hand slapped tortillas made from criollo corn like you are perusing the street fair at 2am in Tijuana. Instead, enjoy your friends' or coworkers' company in a convenient and tolerable location with food that is equally tolerable. Carry out is also a good, quick and fast option.

Each time we have sat at the bar and service has been bad.  Tonight the bar tender gave us water then walked away. No hi no would you like a drink.  Then came back and said would you like to order your food.  We asked could we get a menu of both food and beers?  He brought menus over and the first couple of beers we ordered he said oh we no longer have that.  Finally we got beers they had.

In a side note vodka was getting infused with pineapple in a container by us.  There was a lady who seemed to be training the bartenders.  We asked her about the pineapple and vodka and she said that it had not set nearly long enough but they prided themselves on creating their own mixes that were fresh.

Food wise the chicken parm was good.  The linguine in clam sauce was just all oil and tasteless.  Tonight we had a pizza.  We ordered the sausage with peppers.  it took 55 minutes to get and then came out with sausage peppers and onions.  While we sat at the bar a couple came in and said they were waiting for a table.  Then we watched with them as other couples came in and got tables.  They left in disgust. 

People behind the bar seemed to have no clue.  When our pizza came out we had to ask for plates and silverware.  The bartender said no problem then proceeded to take payments on food so we had to wait even longer.  Then when they offered plates they were dripping wet so we asked if we could get dry plates and they brought them to us.

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says ""some things are better left unchanged"" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.

The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the ""big guys"" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.

If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.

Note: The company that owns Peppermill also has a Peppermill Casino in Reno, Western Village Casino in Sparks, and operates a small Casino called Rainbow Club in Henderson.",4,fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA

Not KFC, not Popeyes (their spicy chicken has gotten tamer and tamer lately...), but Korean Fried Chicken. That should be what KFC stands for now.

The first time I came here, I was sold on their Blazing Fire Chicken. Tender, juicy pieces of chicken with a sweet and gradually spicy sauce on a cast iron plate.

This time around, we got the Blazing Fire Chicken with Cheese. If it's your first time and you want to test your meddle, order this first. It's only got one pepper icon to its name, and I didn't find it as spicy. Still the same amount of deliciousness though!

We also got the Boneless Fried Chicken with Special Sweet Sauce. The chicken was crispy from start to finish, something you rarely see, and the sauce has a nice tang to it. OH SO GOOD.

Another thing you should order of the menu is the Fried Chicken with Green Onion (with lemon mustard sauce). Sweet, onion-y and refreshing!

SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE... I have never seen such terrible customer retention.  Every time I go to their facility, I deal with someone new.  Every time I have called, no one on the other end of the line knows what is going on.  Not the scheduling, not the services, NOTHING.  I have to drive 1 hour and 10 minutes just to reach their office.  So when I make an appointment it is important to me.  Yet...my time seems to mean very little to this office.  I purchased 2 Groupon deals this time around in November...when was I able to finally get in for an appointment you ask?  Glad you asked.  I work 9 plus hours a day every day for 2 week and only have Friday off.  When I called to schedule and appointment, conveniently, the person who does the injections does not have hours on Friday's.  But can have hours until 5:30 on Thursdays.  But...good news is...the clueless girl on the other end of the line was able to schedule me on a day off.  January 1, 2018.  I even clarified with her ""wow, are you sure?? That is New Years day. I cant believe you guys are open that day.  But if you are sure...that will help me so that I do not have to take a day off of work.""  So...I drive up on my holiday to get my injections. Drive over an hour.  Place is deserted when I get there.  Door is locked.  I hang around for half hour and try to call with no answer.  So I drive home.  Completely pissed and then get lost on my way.  I was furious.  I had to pull over so I would not be in an accident.  That is how pissed I was.  Come to find out.  There was a message that I had not gotten to cancel the appointment.  So...I call the office AGAIN. and get someone on the line who tells me ""oh...yeah...she is not with us anymore...she was new"".  Well that is great but doesn't fix my loss of time and day off.  Then I have to explain what service I purchased and they tell me...oh...hang on...I will have to call you back about that.  
Did I get a call back?  Of course not.  so a week goes by and I call again...The girl on the other end tells me that they have been out of Radiesse and will have to call me back when it comes in.   1.5 weeks go by...no call.  Soooo...I call again.  The girl then attempts to schedule me and tells me that she is all booked out for the only time frame I can come in which is the Thursday timeframe after 5pm.  This would mean that I would have to work OVER on hours early in the week to make the appointment but I say...okay, I can do that.  I then tell her that I want to schedule an IPL and would like guidance on what to do first. So I get set up for the IPL and she tells me to wait a week or two before injections.  I ended up purchasing the package deal as I have had the IPL before and it works great on me.  I get the IPL done and had to schedule out as the ""machine was being serviced"".  It has been over two weeks and my skin is clear, but not one single spot is gone like it has been in the past.  when I had it done...my skin is usually red and it was barely red after the treatment and I was surprised.  Well...the way I see it, I wasted my time and this time my money again because it did not work the way it had in the past.  But...I deal with it.   I then call to ask the girl if the Radiesse is in yet so I can schedule my appointment for my injections.  She seems to not answer me almost as if she is not sure who told me that or what I am talking about.  She set  me up an appointment for Thursday, March 1, 2018.  I go ahead and work extra hours early in the week so that I can leave St. Clairsville Ohio by 3:15pm
My appointment is set for 5:30pm.  I figure that will be plenty of time, even with traffic as it is only 1hour and 10minutes away.  I get to the top of Green Tree Hill coming into PItt about 4:15pm maybe a little earlier than that.  The traffic is horrific because of the rain.  When I finally get through the tunnel.  I get onto the bridge...I can see that 279 or 276 or whatever exit takes you to 28 is completely at a stand still..  By the time I got to the split between 279 or Strip district exit it is now about 5:20.  I call the office as I know I will not make it in time and I am pissed that I wasted my time again but the LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS CONTINUE TO THE FACILITY WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER 40 TO 45 MINUTES AWAY BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT.   I get the useless answering service and tell them that I need to get to the office to see if she will need to reschedule me and save me an extra hour to 2 hours of driving.  Or if she is okay with staying a little late.  They tell me ""this is the answering service"" .  I said , ""yes...I heard you the first time.  I know what an answering service is.  I am in traffic and someone is at the office waiting on me.  I need patched through to see if I should still drive all the way there.

The food arrived in take out containers , which was fine however the food was hot , temperature hot, it was inedible . We waited a while and blew on it to cool down, still it was scorching hot. I burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken . 
The food was BLAND so my efforts were for nothing . My husbands food was just as bland and tasteless. 
Then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it. 
I'm sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees . I think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave .

We were allowed to take pictures, and the leisurely pace of the tour was perfect, with room for a little bit of meandering and Q & A peppered throughout. I loved it.

The docent who gave the tour was so knowledgeable. She explained quite a bit of Frank Lloyd Wright trivia and didn't hold back when explaining that the man had quite an ego.

This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza. 

I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. 

One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with). 

The kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza and I loved my pasta (fettucine noodles with pesto sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms. The broccoli was pretty well shredded, but it tasted very good).",9,MkkdOeZYRm84bUQ4vu6O2A

It seemed as if the host was the only one working on the floor on the night that I came. He greeted, seated, took our drink and entree orders, brought out the food, refilled our waters, brought us our check and to-go boxes. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night and they figured it wouldn't be a busy one that they didn't need anyone else working on the floor? Aside from the slow service, they get an A+ for making their female patrons feel loved and appreciated at the end of their meal. Every woman is offered a long stem rose to take home with them.

CRht4ujXUsr95xfGoZVmQw,3,2015-06-07 21:38:02,4,b7TNNG28KBqCrtNr_C0eqQ,"So there's this karaoke rent-a-room and sing with friends type place that's been around forever - everywhere in the world it seems but just recently started up here. Or at least as far as I'm concerned - I'm always late to such parties. There's this place called August Karaoke Box (ÂÖ´ÊúàÊÅãÊ≠å) in Tempe on the south side of University between McClintock and Rural - more specifically in the mall at University @ Dorsey that has businesses like Republic Ramen. You basically pass Republic Ramen and go south into the parking lot and it's in the same building on the east side of the building. There's also a rock climbing place to the south so it can be busy and the parking situation can vary. 

So... I've been here a few times with friends and there are things I like about it and things that I am not particularly pleased with. I'll break it down for y'all...

Pros:

1) During the weekdays of Monday through Thursday before 8 pm you pay 15 bucks an hour. That works out pretty cheap if you come with friends. It's usually not crowded in the afternoons at all. 

2) You get a private room so nobody sees you singing except for your friends if you're the shy type and are mortified about the idea of singing in front of people. This also allows you to try out songs you normally wouldn't dare without any embarassment when the song becomes a trainwreck. 

3) These rooms allow you to have a private party for as long as you like and are willing to pay for. 

Cons:

1) Catalog - I understand that the reason this KTV place even exists is the Chinese speaking clientele - which is why I wasn't too surprised when the receipt I got after paying was almost all in Chinese characters. That said they could use a much bigger English language artist catalog. It's funny that the Rod Stewart and Bee Gees song catalogs are much bigger than the Beatles catalog and there isn't any Rolling Stones at all that I could find. Nor could I find any Eagles. Or Led Zeppelin. Been here a few times and I can see the novelty fading pretty quickly after going through all the available songs that I like/know. It might be my lack of Karaoke GUI navigation skills but I searched by artist and looked at all the offerings for each particular artist. What's weird is you can type in songs by name and they sometimes come up even if the artist isn't listed in the artists section. Oh well. 

2) The way the lyrics show up on the screen are usually two lines at a time. During faster paced songs the transitioning of the lyrics to the next pair of lyrics can sometimes be slow enough that you can be caught waiting/wondering what the rest of the lyrics are (if you don't know the song too well). Most karaoke bar type setups have a full screen of lyrics at a time to avoid that. 

3) The backing tracks/video. So some of the songs have the actual music video or live video of the artists playing their songs. Some of them have some weird Chinese videos of women walking through the street but having nothing to do at all with the song itself. Awkward. But some of the audio tracks sound like MIDI - like you're listening to an old school arcade game rendition of that song. Fortunately not all songs are like that.

If you're a karaoke fan this might appeal to you to try at least once anyway. As always, your mileage may vary.",7,0d7gFJUi4cV3I7j1dHn9fQ

My bf and I stumbled in here after a  phenomenal hike at Red Rock (which you should also look into if you like hikes). Being foodies, we thought of trying the bison burger but the bartender suggested the Elk burger. Not only was it cooked to perfection but the fire pit lounge area will cozy you up regardless of your mood.

First time there, we saw Ms. Bonnie herself - in her 90s, looking great, and eating chicken fried steak in her spot at the end of the bar.

Now Scottsdale and the rest of the Valley are not lacking in sushi restaurants - especially  trendy sceney places.  Yawn.  In fact, I found there to be more sushi bars than I expected for our desert outpost.  But what separates one from the others are: good food, fresh fish, good service, good value.  And this place def does it right...

Plus it's the only place I know of (can anyone help me out here?) in the area where I can find the holy grail of all sushi - the rich, but-gusting, let-me-workout-before-I-eat-this baked scallop roll.  Now, let me explain.   In ""Sushi Heaven"" (otherwise known to laymen as Ventura Blvd. in L.A.) there is this place that serves this and is known for this tasty delicacy.  But I have yet to find a place that serves the baked scallop roll (basically a california roll covered in warmed baked scallops), but along came Sakana. 

Prices are reasonable, the decor is a happy medium - not too trendy, not too drab.  I never have to wait here - but always find myself waiting when I go to RA.  Whatever.  Something is wrong with that picture...

The crowd ranges the spectrum from older couples, families with kids, younger couples, and friends catching up after work.  I hear there are other locations throughout the Valley, but this is the one I frequent.   Another bonus for this place is the location away from Old Town Scottsdale and the parking headaches there.

Being my first time trying a Korean BBQ restaurant, the atmosphere was pretty cool. I enjoyed being able to grill right within my own personal booth. The food came out fresh; definitely loved the grilled calamari and short ribs.

The Negative:
The service at this establishment was atrocious. The wait staff seemed as if I was the bane of their existence each time I had to ask for common items: Soup? Probably need a spoon. Beverage? A refill would be nice. Extra napkins? I can't get by one 1, single ply napkin for my entire lunch. I wish I would have known I could have had a grill change. Probably something to communicate to a first timer, as my grill was, to be expected, very charred.

I think the management of this location needs to impart on their staff that many folks come to KFC to get meals for their entire families. I wouldn't complain so much if Taco Bell messed up a 99¬¢ burrito... but if I'm paying KFC $20 for a family meal and they forget the biscuits or give us the wrong sides, or give us Extra Crispy when we ordered Original I'm going to be ANGRY!

Thanks for all the wonderful yelp reviews~ I finally had my first experience at Egg & I this past Thursday.

My gf & I had breakfast around 11am. It was really crowded but there was only a 10 minute wait.

We ordered the croissant sandwich, I had mines with turkey sausage and fruits and she had hers with bacon and potatoes. 

Service was great, food came out fast. Casual dining, indoor/outdoor seating, private lot. meal for 2 cost around $26. 

I'll be back for more.

Egg & I makes my breakfast in 702 list! If you're looking to get your morning fix, stop by Egg & I!

The restaurant is always clean, employees attentive. Parking can be a challenge at times. The lot is cramped and tiny and easily fills up especially at lunch time.

All in all those of us at work feel the food here is just okay. The ingredients are mediocre. If I could make a comparison for food quality I would compare Venezia's to Pappa John's. It's a few little steps above public school cafeteria food, it will not impress your taste buds but for the price it's a decent value, just don't expect New York deli grade food despite the name.

At work we only go here when we get tired of all the other places we can get delivered. I would suggest you can probably find better in the area of north east Mesa if you look a little online. 

While I have no specific complaints about Venezia's it just isn't that great. Everytime we order here we always end up wishing we had ordered elsewhere. I believe this restaurant is designed to appeal to people between the ages of 12-30 years. It's very loud inside.",3,jLOqQMlhKfvfZ0CZMD4-8g

My cat Leroy came down with something serious right before the holidays, and on top of that, I had a family emergency that meant I had to leave town. Dr. Costa helped alleviate my worries by taking in Leroy and nursing him back to health.  Biggest worry was him not eating for several days and vomiting up everything, including water, and she basically put all the cards on the table, not recommending expensive tests that were unlikely to point to anything definitive and would just hike up costs. Due to his state, if he wasn't eating and keeping it down within the next day or 2, the most likely cause was cancer or foreign obstruction that wasn't showing on the X-rays. She said exploratory surgery was in the future if he didn't start eating, but she wanted to leave that as a last resort if possible. In the end, no surgery was needed, and the combination of medicine she gave him got his appetite back and helped him keep it down while he got better.

Every time she said she'd call me to let me know how he was doing, she did (and this was Xmas eve, Xmas, and the day after). 

Turned out to be a bit of an unexpected expense, but as most pet owners probably feel, it was worth it. Looking over the bill, I don't see anything that was unnecessary (granted, I'm not a vet). And it was actually a bit under what I expected for 5 days of boarding, an IV, couple X-rays to make sure food was going moving thru him all right, and several antibiotics and medications.

As for the cause, that's still a mystery. But the most likely seemed to be a bad batch of food, or something he wasn't supposed to eat, so she advised that I throw away anything that I was feeding him beforehand. And to keep an eye on what he could've possibly gotten into.

Can't thank Dr. Costa and her staff enough for getting my buddy better and helping my situation. I could definitely tell she truly cared about the outcome and was working hard to get him better. She also made a note in her file to call me up in a few days to see how he was doing...never really seen that happen with a vet.  Leroy's currently snuggled up on lap, 100% back to normal.

This was a good choice and their food is very generously portioned. 

We started with a couple of their signature cocktails. Those were pretty weak and pricey for what you get, not really worth the price and not as delicious as the name and description made them out to be.

For food got the tots and mac n cheese and the french dip. The tots is a huge portion covered in cheese sauce. It was good but I think it could use a little more seasoning. The mac n cheese was flavorful but the crispy topping was bland and didn't add anything to the dish. My french dip was just OK, the saving grace was the dip which was super flavorful and delicious. I was dipping everything from the tots to the sandwich into it.

Long story short, I have bad credit that I have been working on repairing for the past several years. I understand that with bad credit, it's hard to get much of anything... So now that my current car that I have purchased several years ago (and PAID OFF) had an A/C that wasn't repairable for the 2nd summer living in Phoenix, I decided it was time for a new car. 

I saved up well over $1,000.00, knowing I have bad credit and would need something to negotiate from a buy here pay here place. I found the Simple Car store from an ad they posted in Craigslist, and it appealed to me because they were close to my work and reported positive to credit card companies (apparently).

Last Thursday, July 30th, I went in, and was told I was ""Preapproved"" and could test drive any car in the lot. I was told with my amount down and what I was looking for (type of cars, payments, etc) that it would be ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM getting me a car, even today if I wanted.

I test drove two vehicles, one 2007 Pontiac G6 with 108k miles on it and also test drove a 2006(if I remember the year) Chevy Cobalt ..... The cobalt was in terrible shape, I can't believe they didn't clean up the interior better honestly. I told the girls after test driving both and looking at the other cars they had on the lot that the G6 would be the only one I was interested in honestly.

I was asked to talk with Alex, whom I was told was the sales manager. She did the paperwork, I gave her all of the personal information she asked me for and said I was APPROVED. I quickly called my boyfriend to come look at the vehicle and bring down a small amount of cash so we could put a hold on the car.... at this point it was too late in the evening to coordinate insurance, so I wanted to complete the sale the next day. I was asked to put $100 down on the car and she would have everything ready for me the next day. I was even given copies of the car info, the carfax, and the loan details that I was ""approved"" for from their financing since I had to do in-house financing with my credit. 

The next day at work there was so much back and forth details it was RIDICULOUS. I put the insurance on the car, only to have Alex text me in the middle of my work day to explain her OWNER declined my loan because of my work history (I just started a new job) and that I needed a cosigner? I ended up leaving work early just so I could go down and see just exactly what was going on..... THIS WAS RAISING A TON OF RED FLAGS FOR ME.

Let me point out also that their ads say all you need is $500 down. Alex tried saying I wanted the most expensive car on the lot so she would have to put me in something cheaper (aka the piece of crap filthy cobalt or something similar on their minimal lot)..... Not to mention the Kelly Blue Book price of the Pontiac G6 was $2,000.00 lower then what they were asking for, even at other dealerships in town and even at other buy-here-pay-here dealerships.

After we got back into this dealership, she said I would need to provide more money down to even get considered. I told her we could do this... We re-negotiated this Loan that I was already supposedly ""Approved"" for ((this is called a yo-yo scam people, look it up)).... After making us wait for an hour, she came back to tell me that once again I was denied the options I was trying to offer to work with THEM.... I thought dealerships were supposed to work with YOU??? I asked she refund the HOLDING FEE that I put down of $100 back on to our credit card and we walked out.....

THIS IS THE REASON I DECIDED TO PUT A BAD REVIEW TO THIS COMPANY ALSO:

Guys, I went to Cactus Jack's Auto, because they posted an ad on Craigslist for the same car: a 2007 Pontiac G6.... The one I ended up purchasing from Cactus Jacks the VERY NEXT DAY had over 20,000 less miles, and was actually $1,500.00 CHEAPER... The loan process took me literally 1 hour, I was approved and driving my new (better) car home. I ended up putting less money down and my payment/loan amount was for half of the time/durration then the one offered to me at ""SIMPLE-RIP-OFF-BULLCRAP-Car-STORE""...

I know its hard if you have bad credit or are trying to fix your old bad credit. Don't feel like you aren't worth it to still shop around and find a better place. They are out there, and this dealership IS NOT ONE OF THEM.....",7,pmo4cKMNtORU-aLWPz4ccg

This was my first time attending after living in Charlotte my whole life.  I didn't have any expectations but the idea of getting to sample a ton of restaurants in the area sounded good to me!

The heat...didn't bother me....the people...didn't bother me...the quality of food...eh, didn't really bother me.
But, what DID bother me was the layout and the quality of vendors.  If you are claiming this is a TASTE of Charlotte then show me something worth tasting.  Hooters?  Salsaritas?  Costco?  Tons of bars and grills?  Come on.  I know there were a couple of good quality restaurants represented but to that point I agree with others that say the crowds are just out of control.  If you have to wait in a 2 hour line to get one of the 3 decent restaurants represented that it holds up the entire walkway..something is logistically wrong.  Maybe this should be held indoors at the convention center?  Maybe on a wider street?  I don't know but something wasn't working and you don't have to be an event planner to know that.

There was an element of class missing from the overall event in my opinion.  I felt like people would rather throw an elbow to get to the chicken wings than enjoy a stroll through yummy food lane.  

Overall...I thought it was brutal.  Would I go back?  Probably not unless I saw that they stepped up the vendor list and that the layout was totally different.

Upon walking in it is loud and a bit small but there is seating outside. The next thing I noticed were the prices. There were close to Five Guys prices and it was over $30 for a beer, fries, two sandwiches and hush puppies. The sum of my Ranch sandwich was not impressive. It was a bit too much bread and I attribute this to the thin piece of chicken that was in it. It was much thinner than a Chik Fil A patty. The chicken was tasty so I would do a leg or breast the next time I visit if I do again. The fries were good but standard at best.

Once you exit Chester Station and look towards the main street (Danforth) you should see it.  Literally a 30 second walk.
There is PAID Green P parking beside Chester Station.  $6 full day or $1 every half hour (bring coins or it takes credit card).

Facility: Spacious show room(s)! When we arrived, we thought that there was only one room, when in fact, there are at least two more.  I was disappointed to find this out over halfway through the appointment though.  I would have like to explore more.  I did see at least two sitting rooms where the bride could come out to the three-way mirror.

Service: We arrived on time was right away, were were greeted.  I was asked about my budget, my wedding the styles I liked right off the bat. Consultant, Linda, was very attentive. I wished she took the time to get to know me a little more but it WAS a Saturday and there were other brides.  She did make me feel like I was her only bride though which was great. I NEVER felt rushed.  In fact, on a Saturday, we were going over our 1.5 hours and I felt bad so I constantly said ""After this one, we can wrap it up."" But Linda was great and pulled a few more dresses (more in tune with my tastes). I loved that I could take my time and that the consultants didn't ""vulture"" over us.

Dresses: Sample dresses are not in the best condition (some are ripped, torn etc), BUT it's the design were are looking at.  The selection was GREAT, and I was so disappointed that I didn't have enough time to look through them all.  I will be returning.

Price: I gave them my price point and my consultant pulled only dresses within my budget.  It was great because it was one less thing I had to worry about so I could really just focus on the dress. They offer discounts for off-site alterations and gave us some ""tokens"" for discounted lunch and coffee in the area. Many dresses I saw were between $1000 - $2000.

Fitting Room: Quite small.  I really wished they were bigger.  With some of the more flowy dresses, I felt like I was swimming in the fitting room. There was only enough room for myself and one BM to help me into my dress. 

Photos: Not allowed.  My MOH was unable to attend but I was allowed to take photos of the highest dress contender. I was very happy they were able to accommodate my request which in the end, helped me to decide that I WILL be purchasing a dress from Becker's, just have to find the ONE.

Overall: Service was okay, I had hoped the consultant(s) would have gotten to know me a little better and pick up on my tastes a little more quickly.  It's a good thing that I am a quick and decisive bride. I was disappointed in some of the damage on the sample dresses but I LOVED the variety and the prices of their dress selections.  In the end, what made this a great experience was the selection, the price and the no pressure atmosphere (something rare on a Saturday).  I will be returning to Beckers and I DO recommend them!



Second visit:

On my second visit, I was pretty sure I would be committing to a dress that day.  I went on a Saturday and IT. WAS. PACKED.  However, I think the consultants knew that I would be buying so our party ending up in the one private suite instead of a fitting room. This time, we got Kathy.  She NAILED my taste and the FIRST dress she brought in was the One. Kathy really seemed to know her stuff! I felt that my second appointment went much better than the first.  Though I went over the time slot, Kathy accommodated me and my party for however long I needed.



Phone service: Spoke with Liat.  She was very sweet and understanding.  No complaints!!



Third visit:

This visit was to confirm and order the dress.  I asked Amanda at the front if I could have a button down back rather than the zipper and she said yes that it could be ordered with that change.  I later mentioned it to Kathy who said told me no, that the dresses come as is, but once I told her that Amanda said yes, she checked and it was a go.  Service was always great and once you have committed to buy the dress, they will allow you to take photos.

-------------------------------------------

Brides notes:
- when you are allowed,  TAKE LOTS OF PHOTOS!!  You won't see your dress for months, you definitely want something to look forward to when you get home.

- the dress I chose was an in-house designer, Jayne Lewis.  Another reason you will want to take boatloads of photos is because this ""designer"" does not have stock images.  Actually there really is no information online about Jayne Lewis/Jayne Louis.  I am convinced that these dresses are out-sourced to China.  However, I LOVE my dress and I am okay with it.

- it will get HOT, even in November/December.  Wear deodorant!!

- look at yourself OFF the pedestal

- look at the BACK of your dress as you walk away to see if you like it

- if I went back, I'd ask for Kathy right off the bat~",2,LTnCcTKbS-SBQlFGJ5Jm7g

And wow! Pleasantly surprised with their coffee. I wasn't expecting much since it's not a dedicated cafe, but wow, their coffee is insanely strong (you can choose between regular and strong-- I chose strong). Bitter, of course, but wonderful. Finally, something to knock out the weakling brews nearby.

The only bubble tea made with fruit instead of a fruit and powder mix is lychee, which is yummy but I wish more of the drinks were made with 100% fruit.  Contrary to another reviewer, I got a lot of tapioca IMO. I don't think there's a *great* place for bubble tea in Champaign, but Coco is good. You can ask to look at their ingredients list, and let me save you the surprise, it is crap. A huge amount of sugar too. 

The only true downsides are that the interior design is bad and some kid thought it'd be funny to sneeze all over the machines and the staff did nothing about it. The design is not the worst I've seen... but it's pretty ugly and pretty obvious that they didn't hire a good designer. It's the floor... And the kinds of light fixtures they have... Especially that awful LED tree... And how the counter and the area behind the counter look. The place doesn't look put together. There's no flow-- only a big box with an ascetic layout and poor decor. You can see what the big end goal was... And it wasn't reached. When I think of how Coco looks, I think of the yellow ""you tried"" star meme. They tried. But the ambience doesn't detract from the food.",0,WJdXYIM5cphh_28C5Bhnfw

We did purchase a charcoal grill just because we were making a special dinner that charcoal would work better then the gas; it was a nice one so the next renters can use it. I felt like there was good communication with Peter. We took special care to follow the check in and out instructions but were unable to upload our exit video but there was nothing negative to report. We would go through Crystal Properties again if we decide to hold our reunion there again. Keep in mind the house was built in the 80's but the refrigerator and freezer were top of the line holding the massive amount of food we went though during our stay. Per instructions we washed all towels using newer washing machines. We liked the space, location was close to everything, with two pools one being covered we spent hours outside even in the 100 degree temp. 
the only issues we had was with the pool spa thing that must be set on a timer because in the morning the spa thing would be full and running and in the later afternoon it wouldn't be but it was not a issue worth calling about. That and the door alarm would go off at times which might have been a battery issue.

What happened to the day they would clear dishes (she walked away without taking the dirty dishes with her) and make their presence known but not interrupt people while they are deep in discussion? Topic for next staff meeting: don't interrupt customers conversations while they are dining. Approach quietly, wait to be recognized, then speak. Or slowly cruise around so if anyone needs something you are available, but don't just barge into someone's conversation ""IS IT GOOD?"" ugh :(

Lastly, there was a hair in my salad. It was at the very bottom and it was odd because my friend and I were just talking about how the salad dressing was at the bottom .. like someone put the salad dressing in first then put everything on top of it. Low and behold, I am looking into my dish and there is a crazy looking hair.

Ugh. Pic attached.

I let the server know. She apologized and took it away. I was in shock so I just sat quietly, you know you start to look around like is there hair in my other food? Or drink? LOL

Then a manager comes up, saying his name is Doug. He apologized and let me know my meal charge has been removed from the tab. He says we can get any dessert we want, no charge. We said it was okay and he said if we needed anything else to let him know. We talked briefly about hair nets and Doug said everyone there wears them in the kitchen including beard nets, but our server had long hair that was not in a net so it kind of confused me.

We paid the bill and left. We didn't take him up on a free dessert. They removed the charge for my lunch off the bill, but we still paid for my guests lunch and both of our non-alcoholic beverages.

The lighter flavoring can also describe the lamb skewer, which are adorned with just a dusting of cumin seasoning - generally tasty and the meat is tender, though more time on the charcoal would have developed more flavor. The beef pancake was a little disappointing - not a whole lot of beef and pancake, though flaky on the outside, was a little gummy inside.

My favorites dishes of this restaurant are Spicy Beef Noodles Soup, Garlic Rice with Marinated Short Ribs, and last but not least, the House Special Crab. I think i would give this restaurant an A plus for not having MSG and also not letting the food get so greasy . 
 The ambiance is lovely and soothing. i I think this restaurant can be a better suited place  to a quiet evening with the family/casual dinner with friends. I would come back to try more food here for next  time visiting Vegas.",0,6QdVYi9qLT7szm2KME6Cpw

There regular menu might be executed better, though I doubt I will be back to find out.  For those of you trying to select which restaurant to try for Restaurant week a word (or many) of caution.  
I decided to go with the wine pairings, which were ok though nothing to write home about.  Let me start with the bread, as I have come to judge a restaurant on this initial offering.  While not offensive the baguette had a chewy almost stale exterior-nothing like the crust you would find in any boulangerie in France.  I do wish that American restaurants would serve homestyle bread or even focaccia, rather than a poorly executed artisanal bread.  I did appreciate that the butter was salted and at room temperature rather than ice cold.  Onto the appetizer: I opted to start with the ravioli with truffle essence and fine herbs.  The only redeeming element of this dish was the faint flavor of truffle.  The pasta itself was tough.  It actually reminded me of the refrigerated ravioli you can buy at Trader Joes.  The broth that it came in was ok, but nothing that you would want to soak up the extra with your bread.  The best part of my dinner was the 2nd offering-the scallop mousse.  It was seasoned well and had a texture that would remind you of a cross between a panna cotta and egg custard.  The flavor was fresh, though the few peas on top were a but starchy.  I ended the meal with the sole entree. The sole lacked even the tiniest bit of salt or pepper, as did the steamed cauliflower beneath.  The sauce swirled around the perimeter of the plate was quite tasty, however, each element of a dish must be seasoned properly for it to be enjoyable to eat.  Given that I had expected to gorge myself on delicious food, I had eaten a very small lunch.  After leaving over half of the tough pasta and an entire filet of sole, I left the restaurant still hungry and set back $70.  If in the Biltmore area and looking for a nice meal, I would suggest Seasons 52.  Although not as trendy or fancy, I also have had much better food at Zinburger and True Food.",0,1-89Kh794s2dAuLrhje_hw

the husband and i stopped by with some friends for some froyo and smoothies with a livingsocial deal. we had just had an incredible brunch at ncounter and decided to use the deal since it was getting hot out. 

we walked in, happily served ourselves yogurt, ordered a smoothie, and proceeded to pay by showing the cashier my voucher on my phone, which I've done a countless times at countless businesses all over the Valley and have NEVER had a problem with it.

The employee had to contact her manager, as she told us we had to have the voucher printed out to be accepted.... which it says NOWHERE on the voucher itself. The manager said no, it had to be printed.  So we asked to speak with the manager on the phone ourselves, as we had already gotten our yogurt/smoothies and were planning on using the voucher to pay (the main reason for us to even stop in). We literally had loaded up on the yogurt BECAUSE you had to use the entire $15 amount in one visit. 

The manager REFUSED to accept our voucher number via the iPhone app and said that they would only accept printed vouchers, that it was their company policy. I'm sorry, is your company policy to be rude to your clientele? He was completely unhelpful and unapologetic, and refused to write down our voucher number and let us return with a printed voucher later in the day. We ended up paying full price for our yogurt/smoothies, although we should have just set our things down and left after that.

I would not have a problem with providing a printed voucher IF that was what was stated on either my phone voucher OR my computer downloaded voucher (both of which state the option of either printing the voucher out OR presenting it on your LS smartphone app.) 

In short? I will never again patronize a Red Mango, much less this location. I advise all potential customers to instead choose Mojo which is just north of this location on Mill, OR hop in the car and head to Yogurtland on Rural south of the 202 near In-N-Out.

My scenario as I write this. I've been here since 10am this morning and bought 2 pumpkin spiced lattes, 2 hot chocolates, a plain bagel, iced coffee, Chocolate chip scone (brought my older daughters with me & my husband) and we've been sitting enjoying the shop and doing some work.  The girl mixed up our drinks but we figured it out after a couple of sips. 

Lunchtime rolls around...getting hungry lol and I place an order with ARI(?) for a medium iced tea and THE CARLOS sandwich at 12:55pm and received my food at 1:23pm. 28 MINUTES LATER!! No word until I walked up front and she saw me, then said it would be a few more minutes.

They don't pay attention to detail and if the owners not here, that's very evident in all aspects. No music playing, dishes on table, floors dirty, attitudes, etc.

Everything else was pretty bland, especially the desserts. Most of them had very little flavor which upset me because the Oreo cheesecake just tasted like mush, and the key lime tart was also very plain tasting.

Then, the starter course: a tomato and goat cheese tart for my dining companion, and a mesclun salad with roasted tomatoes for me. The tart's crust was too thick. My salad was good but unremarkable. 
For the main courses, we had a pork chop with apple stuffing and a steak with tomato butter. Both cuts of meat were overcooked, tough, and dry. The vegetable side of julienned carrots and squash was OK, just a tad overcooked as well. I am a little forgiving with the steak because it was clearly grass-fed beef; however, a skilled chef would know that these cuts of meat require different cooking methods, including marinating. 

For dessert, we had the creme brulee and mousse au chocolat. Both were so-so. I prefer my mousse to be more light and airy, but this mousse is thick and heavy. 

Because of the outstanding service and other good reviews, I will give this place a second chance. But I will order fish the next time!",2,q7-e8sy9M_8mO3d4Q6DiNA

When I remind them that we have a reservation, the hostess said ""Unfortunately whoever maid the reservation did not specify where you wanted to sit, and all we have available is the bar or patio"".  We sat on the patio, even though It was high-top tables with tall chairs.  There was a couple also waiting for a table that had a reservation for 45 minutes prior, and they decided to wait for a table.

The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.

This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.

Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.

The housekeeping staff was exceptional and friendly the times we ran into them. Annabelle specifically took great care of us and was very patient when we happened to return to the room while she was trying to straighten it up. The staff giving out towels at the pool was friendly and outgoing. The room itself was on the 30th floor and we enjoyed the view. The pool was clean and enjoyable. That said, we hit a few snags. The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way, I was waiting in line for the concierge. Had been waiting for about 5 minutes as they were busy. I was up next and the woman made direct eye contact with me. I started to move forward as it was my turn and a man walked up and cut right in front of me. Instead of telling him that I was next, she helped him first. Pretty bad customer service in my opinion. The second issue was the bathroom. It had a bad smell when we first checked in. I spent my first two days outside of Vegas so I didn't really care. When I came back, it had gotten completely unbearable. I called to report it and all I said was that I had noticed an unpleasant odor in the bathroom. The woman repeated back to me, ""you smell sewage in the bathroom, we'll be right up."" I never said that but it led me to believe that this is a recurring problem that they just stick a bandaid on whenever there's a complaint. That said, someone arrived quickly to repair it, left to get some tools, came back and fixed it. He promised it'd be better within 24 hours and it was.

We were seated immediately on the patio, and we quickly obtained a table.  That was the last ""quick"" part about the meal.  Service was slow for drinks, orders, food, and bill.  It was okay as we enjoyed the waterfront dining, but it got to be a little tiresome as the evening progressed.  

The appetizer was the ""PCC Trio"", which included a pimento cheese that I simply haven't adjusted to yet.  The pico was flavorful, and I really enjoyed the pita chips.

The beer I had hoped for was not available (Wicked Weed Coolcumber, which I had there in June and it was awesome in 100 degree heat), but that happens and I'm not docking my review for that.  However, I will fault the place for how long it took to get a beer.  I'd say the inside was at about 40% full, and the patio seating was almost full, but the place just didn't seem busy enough to justify the delays.  Our server was friendly, and we liked her, we just wish maybe we'd have seen a little more of her.  

For dinner I had the Pacific Cod sandwich, fired in a tempura batter and served with fries.  I ordered a caesar salad as well, which I would have thought would be served with the appetizer course, but it wasn't.  The timing of the meal was just off with the appetizers and mains.  The fish was enormous, and it was good, but not great. 

Everyone seemed to like the food, but the delays in all aspects of the service put a serious damper on the evening. We'll try it again if only for the amazing view (and my favorite thing - dining under palm trees!), but I'm going to be hoping for an improvement on the service side.

Finally, I feel like maybe this place isn't sure what it wants to be.  The decor inside is attempting to be upscale, as it some of the menu, but yet it caters to people coming in off their boats docked outside dressed for lake activities.  I think there's nothing wrong with it, but the formal atmosphere inside clashes with the clientele.  

As I said, I will go again, but I hope that the next time is better.",0,o8atC3wzjulaouXYWyZwvg

We come here when we treat ourselves to the attached farmer's market on Saturday morning. We also recently discovered the dinner special on Sunday and Monday evenings where you get a deeply discounted three course meal for $12.99. And that's why we are here tonight.

Every employee is friendly. It's striking. They are kind and helpful. For someone who tries to follow a paleo diet I do need to feel comfortable with a server to ask for what I want. That has never been a problem here. 

My favorite meal so far has been the roasted cauliflower. Tonight I am trying the rotisserie chicken. It was very moist and flavorful.

Generally speaking, I like what's known as the ""white food."" At Thai Original BBQ I'm a big fan of their lunch specials. You get a great little side salad, then your main course for less than $9, not a bad deal.

So my staple item at this location is good ol' #1, the BBQ Chicken with Fried Rice. 90% of the time the chicken is moist, the skin has great flavor, and it's cooked to perfection. Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side. Periodically I'll go off the deep end and get the Pad Thai, which is decent, but I'm quickly reminded that nothing beats the BBQ chicken.

Definitely a good lunch stop, great prices, and quick service.",1,6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg

They were cooked in some sort of light red sauce. I don't remember what it was called. It seemed to be a mix between tomato and Marsala.

The first thing I noticed is that the ticket booth has been taken over by robots with giant touch screens and one ""real person"" behind them to help people navigate the menus.  I found the interface to be pretty easy...  there's a weird CC reader to the side that reminds me of Tron for some reason.  The poor employee has to careen his arms and neck to see the screens and help people with their transactions, but overall... still a ""good"" change in my opinion.  There are still stanchions for crowd control, but maybe this new system really cuts down on having lines form.

Same basic layout, just renovated carpet and seats...  the seats actually have touch buttons that you see on the theaters preview reel.  Easy to operate in the dark, and easy to reset, once the movie has ended because the button is back lit.

Since I purchased my ticket with the kiosk, the only person I had to talk to was the ticket-taker.  He was pleasant enough...  maybe one day, it will be replaced by a robot as well....

My friends were married here several months ago and I have to say that with all the wedding chapels and options Vegas has to offer, this place is over priced and under impressive to me. Their wedding was pre-planned/scheduled in advance, yet when we arrived it was like a cattle call inside when it came to ushering the wedding group in and out. Other brides and wedding parties were waiting in the small waiting area, it felt less personalized this way. The staff was nice, but they moved everyone around frantically, which sort of made all of us feel frantic and rushed.

Sure it looks like a chapel inside, and if that's what you're going for great. But with red carpeting, old white pillars and lattice work it looks like a chapel out of the late 70's; seems tacky rather than classy.

The pros: they have a limo service for the wedding party, to and from any downtown hotel. They will tailor the ceremony to religious needs and wants, like the use of a bible or unity candles, etc.

The cons: pretty pricey - they paid over $2,500 for a pretty basic package that included photos. Also, they don't allow any other photos during the ceremony because the photographer doesn't want her shots messed up.

I suppose all Vegas wedding chapels come off feeling a little cheap, but don't expect it to be cheap on your pocket book.",9,m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ

Located on the corner of Bonneville at the Juhl, le Pho is an amazing little spot with fresh quality yummy Pho.

Close to our house we come here quite often. 

We always order either jasmine or pomegranate rooibos hot tea. 

Our app is always the vegan roll a soft hand roll filled with shiitake, radish, asparagus and other yummy veggies, including Thai basil. They come with a large dish of hoisin/peanut sauce. 

My better half always orders vegan Pho. Amazing broth full of flavor and A TON of noodles. Exactly how we love it. It has red onion, scallion, fresh zucchini, and sprouts on the side.
I always take all the Thai basil, lime slices and fresh jalape√±o off the side topping plate. :D Hubs likes it without. 

Sometimes instead of Pho I order the vermicelli bowl and ask for it vegan. They pile it high with tons of fresh veggies and if I like they add crispy tofu or saut√©ed tofu. Its fine without it!

This hotel is clearly older, the maintenance is a little questionable but the rooms are surprisingly nice. However, I have only stayed at the Mardi Gras tower, so I'm only saying that from this particular room. The best part of this hotel is the obvious location - you really cannot beat the location. Right on the strip, the back door is right across the Forum Shoppes and it's walking distance to anywhere fun. 

One thing that bugged me was the front desk. Coming from hospitality, it's surprising how few front desk agents they had during the busiest of check-in times. We were standing in line to check in for a good half hour or so and the line went out the door. Once we got to the front desk agent, she was friendly, but no apologies for the wait or anything extra. On a side not, she also kept pushing us to take a smaller room, which we found completely odd. I assume they were either oversold in a certain room type, or oversold in general, but pushing someone to take a lesser room is completely unprofessional. 

That brings me back to my own words though, don't expect service from this hotel. That's not their focus. 

I didn't visit any restaurants, mostly because they didn't look very good. Besides, you're on the center of the strip, you should probably be going to better places to eat!

In conclusion, I would go back. The price was right and I'd rather spend that little extra money on a craps table or a yard of Fat Tuesday over staying at a nicer hotel when I'm only utilizing the bed for a few hours!",2,KWbz9wkr3uV4vBS9OqQRVA

The Barvarian Creme donut was fresh and the coffee was good. The egg muffin with cheese and bacon was hot.

It took a while for us to get the hot item stuff. Woman behind us was not too pleased with the waiting time.

Hubby and I were big fans on Tagan and Frank's Amaro in Cave Creek, but sadly, things went way downhill when they left :(  We were eager to see what they came up with in their new digs, and we were over the moon!

First of all, just loved the space which is designed with comfort in mind. The spacious semicircle booths which line one side of the room are fabulous. I wish more restaurants understood the concept of the booth! And the bar . . . it has plenty of seating to schmooze up to it, grab a beer, kick back and watch a game with your friends. Nook could be trendy, but it reminds me more of a real neighborhood restaurant and bar, the kind like in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.  

The menu is eclectic, but favors the Italian cuisine. You can choose decadent, like the Arancini, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, with the best tasting fresh house-pulled mozzarella, or choose healthy, like the halibut tacos or albacore salad. For our first time, we chose decadent - the Arancini was delectable, and the langoustines were sweet and tender while the accompanying sauce had just the perfect bite. Hubby had the scrumptious Black Forest Ham sandwich which came with perfect fries. I couldn't resist the Gamberetti e Funghi pizza (shrimp, enoki mushrooms, parmesan and mozzarella).  I issue a challenge to anyone who says that shrimp doesn't belong on pizza!!!  Our informative and friendly waiter Jorge almost issued the same challenge to me . . . by remarking that he had only taken two orders for that pizza before and both were decidedly thrilled with their choice! The thin crust pizza was spot on . . . a melding of flavors and textures that really worked magic in my mouth. As an aside, I initially wanted to order it with gluten free crust, but they were out of it. I am not gluten-free as a medical necessity, but by choice . . . Nice to know they ""sometimes"" have it. You might want to call ahead to make sure it is available if that's important to you.

We love that the owners greet you at the door, and that they make time to check in with you, see if you like the food, have opinions, etc. They are eager to make Nook a place for you to call home and feel at home.

How about apologizing profusely and asking when it would be convenient for me to reschedule if I choose to do so. You'd think I was the provider and you were the customer.

Sean and I checked this place out last Friday night with another couple after reading the impossibly good reviews on Yelp and we are SO glad we did! It's been a long time since we tried a new spot and were so pumped to go back!

We were interested in trying out a couple of the drinks but were intrigued also by 3 tacos for $7.50. Not a special - that's the regular price. Bomber! Excellent, fresh tacos. We had the meat ones - two pork (al pastor and carnitas) and one beef. Absolutely yummy in every way and for that price - holy crap! On Taco Tuesday, it's even more ridiculously cheap - 3 for $5. It's like stealing for as good as these damn things are. 

Now the drinks. Between the 4 of us, we must have tried 12 drinks. All amazingly different and unique. All mixed and served with extreme care from ingredients to garnish. I mean this freakin place has little plastic mermaids and dry ice to go in the drinks for crissakes! So awesome. 

The atmosphere and service were outstanding in every way. Our server (wish I could remember her name but I was lucky to remember my own name after a few here) was SO nice, genuine and knowledgable. Tell her if you like rum or gin, sweet or not and she'll pick out a drink for you that you'll really like. I was not disappointed in the three I tried. Dark, chill atmosphere - unobtrusive music, tiki glassware wall, outrigger canoe up in the rafters. This place meets the definition of 'lounge' when so many places don't. 

The general manager, Shan, spent a good amount of time chatting us up and telling us all about the venture. Good dude, that guy.

The ONE downside I can possibly think of: difficult, un-walkable location. Now this is on one hand great - if it were on the main Ohio City drag, this place would be as packed as Town Hall - or maybe not because those types don't really like to pay $10-12 per cocktail. Either way, it would be nice if it were in an easier to access location. Also, no phone number because 'we don't have a phone'. Normally that might seem clueless, but with as awesome as this place is, it's almost on purpose. Like only the true believers will find the oasis.

A friend & I split the Regular Poutine w/ Chicken Gravy ($5) and the Pulled Pork Poutine w/ Goat Cheese & BBQ Sauce ($6.50).  The regular is the better of the two in my book.  I would definitely stick with that.  My friends liked the pulled pork one better.  I admit the pulled pork was good and not characteristically dry like how most pulled pork is.  However, the pulled pork poutine pales in comparison to the original regular poutine.  Goat cheese & BBQ sauce can't replace the fatty A magic of cheese curds & gravy.  Reggie's uses chicken gravy, which is very good.  This might possibly be my favorite poutine place.

I stopped in yesterday for lunch. The menu is pretty simple, sandwich, salad, pizza cone or veg or non veg bowl are basically your choices. I placed my order with a nice girl for a Veggie bowl, priced around 7 bucks. While waiting at the counter I noticed a few things... Lots of foil pans of food sitting around on carts and counters. Not sure if that's what the use to prepare all the orders or if it was a big catering order or what. I watch them make a pizza cone (they wear gloves, yay!), they dump mac n cheese into a previously used bowl that had been sitting on the counter and mix the barbecue meat into it and then add it to the cone with more meat (chicken, I think) on top. The use of the dirty bowl grossed me out. I also notice a gallon container of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in the back but OK. It's been about 15 minutes and a lady catches me watching and she tells me I can have a seat and they will bring my food out to me. So I have a seat for about 6 minutes. I then ask a guy who is handing out the orders, ""how much longer will it be?"" he then asks the one who took my order if she working on the Veggie Bowl, she replies ""she is"" talking about the other worker that is stir frying the veggies.

First with my used car for oil changes; then I bought a new car from them and have been using them for regular maintenance and the warranty repairs. There are several reasons why I feel the service for Toyotas should be outsourced:

1. This dealership does not want you to come back for service, they have no incentive to provide quality service. This is reflected in the failure to repair items the first time and the employee callus response when you tell them the vehicle has been there for this simple repair previously. There is absolutely no accountability and they just don't care.

2. Expect to wait 4+ hours for something simple like an oil change or just changing out a light bulb. It doesn't matter if you're paying cash, have a financed maintenance plan or are in for a warranty repair. This is a problem they could fix by having longer hours during the weekend when it is most busy; but instead they close at 5 on Saturday and don't open at all on Sunday. If you have a problem outside those hours, there is no one to help you. The sales department manager won't even answer his phone or call you back. The roadside assistance is a joke. If you make it through the myriad of phone prompts, expect to have all kinds of problems getting someone to you.

3. They won't do all services and their recommended Vendor for windshield repair/replacement installed my windshield twice where I could push the glass out afterward. Took 3 separate visits to get the glass actually touching the glue. -- I had a 8 inch crack, got it replaced, had to get up charged for the Toyota glass, didnt touch the glass at all, but could feel the wind coming through it on the freeway. Took two more visits before the tech just pushed on the glass and said ""there's the problem"" displaying the obvious gap. Smh.

4. Once they have your vehicle in service they have no incentive to get it back to you. So you may go days without a car with no notice. -- They  do have a courtesy shuttle when they are open; but you may wait 3+ hours after it is scheduled to pick you up. 

5. They can't get Toyota parts same day even if you've made an appointment in advance and they know the issue. It's usually 3 days to a week and then you get to come back when the parts arrive and start the process all over again. One time, they told me they would call me when the part arrived, a month later I called them and found out it had arrived they held it and then they returned it. So I had to wait again for them to reorder the part. Another time I had to leave my car there while they could troubleshoot with corporate, which is only weekdays. So that was another day without my car, and more rides.

Normally I'm very understanding of a busy day at the dealership and I was excited to have a standard new vehicle that would be easy to repair.  -- but this service department destroys the reliable and easy to work on reputation of Toyota by making regular maintenance a nightmare.

 This time its just the side mirror interior part that broke and 2nd time in on the same brake light replaced. This will be my last visit here. I just don't have the time for this nonsense. 

I remember the 90's well, when Jiffy Lube had all the parts and could do my service, replace my windshield wipers and break lights in under an hour.

I am seriously considering trading it in for a Honda just so I can take it anywhere for service.",14,cVz8ZPsnXCzb_ovHv13LBA

Thankfully they were giving water away all day because food prices are out of this world.  We did pack a cooler for lunch but ended up financing someone's retirement with an afternoon snack at Chick Fil A in the park.  There were a couple of coasters that were new to me.  The water park was too crowded to enjoy.  All in all an enjoyable day but glad to see my driveway at 130 in the morning.  Park was fun and lines werent extremely long.  Food was horrible and overpriced.  The best part of the day was watching Snoopy on Ice.  Great show and air conditioned.  Will go back in another twenty years.,1,K8mRAWnTtGetOPqlMb9Sow
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,0,2017-08-15 21:37:19,0,jIncah5_jGLltxAj4T9beA,"I expected to be writing a 5 star review for this buffet. It wasn't terrible by any means, but I guess they've really scaled this back since it began. The selection was not what I expected from the earlier reviews and pictures. There were only 3 kinds of charcuterie meats and 3 cheeses with no crackers. There was no tomahawk ribeye, no Wagyu beef sliders, no street corn, no souffles, no creme brulee, very little in the way of fruit, and only a few tired baskets of fries. I saw pictures here of fried fish, fried chicken and wings. Where were they? Lots of things were missing. I thought they'd have king crab for a Saturday night.

The pros: The crab legs (get the steamed ones, better consistency), the line people/servers/busboys were very nice and helpful (they were 5 stars), the pot stickers, the crepes, the pork belly, the char siu pork, the Peking duck (need pancakes please), and the gelato. The guy that grilled me a corn tortilla was very nice. The ticket for your wait time and text when ready to be seated was very convenient. I liked it even with the 2.5 hour wait. It's easy to kill time and walk around.

The hit or miss: The prime rib. The first piece my daughter got was a perfect medium rare. The second one was tough and un-chewable. The color was off.

The meh: The soup dumplings were small and devoid of broth. They may as well have been more pot stickers.

There was nothing really bad at all. It was mostly very good. I know I sound picky what with all the choices they did have, but this was a very high end, high priced buffet. This is not an every day thing for us and I expected to be wowed. I've had comparable middle of the road price range buffets. The lack of selection puzzled me, but it must work for them in terms of what gets eaten.",0,lMKuPHjb0EyD3MiPC4jJJA

Think ""ninja warrior meets Parkour"" in the activities.  It's more ""obstacle course"" focused with space to also bounce and do dodge ball - so the variety is impressive.  It also has a rockwall that the kids can just jump off into a foam pit and a basketball section.  The staff were really friendly and helpful - and played with my kids and showed them how to do stuff, which was really great.  It was heavily staffed, so I felt like the supervision and oversight were awesome and reassuring.
They have a small cafe and tons of sitting area for parents on a catwalk or down in the area between the door & the play area.  
They don't have the long ""running track"" style trampolines or any bounce houses - although there is a toddler area with a foam pit for smaller kids - but it's pretty small.
My only complaint is that it's a little pricey (both for bounce time and for cafe).  But overall, it's fun.",3,7HmXaZ1C8--Mt4MyItJiqg

1. Great facilities...we chose this over LA Fitness which is closer to our house because we wanted the steam room...
2. Usually no waiting on classes or machines at any time we have been there...
3. Staff is mostly friendly and Club Manager personally spoke with us to help resolve some of the issues below....
4. 2 hot tubs, so one is always open..other clubs seem to close it when I want it most..also  steam and dry sauna are very well maintained...I wish they were coed, but despite being in the locker-room, they require bathing suits anyway so I'm not sure why my wife and I have to split up to go in them...it tends to shorten our use...
5. they have good towel service for no extra cost

Now the negatives:
1.  soap/shower gel in shower area is poor...need a better gel/body wash
2. install ""rain heads"" in at least a few of the showers like 24 hour fitness...
3. locker room is trashed at 5AM..wet towels everywhere on floor...obvious night staff doesn't clean it up
4. there was SO MUCH the membership people didn't tell us during our signup....ASK ABOUT THE SMALL PRINT:
 a.  was given one week guest pass and NOT told guests can't come in till 9am until I got there at 0500 before work!
 b. Was told we could get 50 minute massage for $20 for first 30 days.  Was NOT told you have to AKS for the special NEW BEGINNINGS deal and actually had to cancel a 30 minute $40 massage after we arrived...then we were told that they DIDN""T GIVE THE CHEAPER MASSAGES ON FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AND THEY WERE BOOKING 13 DAYS OUT FOR THOSE......none of which we were told when we called to schedule or when we arrived...very embarrassing.  in Marketing, that's called BAIT AND SWITCH OR FRAUD for short....
 c. Lastly, the FREE MyLTF bucks they promised EXPIRE in 30 days, so we quickly decided to use them for personal training...what we got was a high pressure SALES PITCH that rivaled ANY TIME SHARE PRESENTATION I've ever been to...we walked out after being told we needed to pay for ""advanced VO2 testing, pay for a Nutritionist, and that our 4 free sessions wouldn't be enough to orient my wife with the machines because ""they were used for basic teaching "" and there was too much information she needed to know first before they could get to the workout....we specifically told them we wanted to use all 4 sessions to set up a workout plan for her (we are both experienced gym members and have used training before).  We were again told that what WE wanted would take PAID sessions and then told that OUR GOALS WERE UNREALISTIC AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO SET A MORE REALISTIC GOAL FOR US.  We were also told that the FITNESS TEST, which was offered as a FREE BENEFIT during our signup by our membership coordinator, would COST US ONE TRAINING SESSION...When I argued that that was not the deal they told us, he said ""Well why didn't your membership guy schedule it then?""  We don't have children in swim lessons and with a  30 day expiration date, these MyLTF Bucks are basically worthless to us...the spa is much more expensive than we would use for services like haircuts, nails, etc.  If you just want a gym to work out at, go to this club...if you plan on using services and LIKE HIGH PRESSURE, CANNED USED CAR-TYPE SALES PITCHES go to this club .....

She let me know the safest ways to color change and what would be best for what I was going for since I didn't want to go to full black hair from my brownish/ blonde hair I currently had. 
Once we figured out what we were doing, she poured me some champagne and I just sat back in the chair and waited for her to do her magic!

My sister, though, always the unadventurous eater, wanted us to get the Forza: what seems to be a simple pie with pepperoni, Gouda, Ricotta, and tomatoes. I begrudgingly agreed to what I assumed would be an uneventful and boring pizza experience. 

BOY, WAS I WRONG. The Forza, the absolute ""safest"" pizza we could find on the menu, was packed to the brim with flavor and quality. Deliciously sweet dollops of cheese perfectly balanced whole cloves of roasted garlic and juicy (but not too juicy!) tomatoes, making my taste buds practically break out in angelic song with every single bite. I will definitely be coming back here to try the creative and inspired masterpieces of culinary recipe that originally drew me to Sal's, like the Carbonara, the Fig and Bacon, and probably all the rest of the menu as well.

On Monday I finally got a person on the phone.  I was told there was no manager available.  I explained the issue and she told me sorry you must of got a bad box.  She offered to replace the strawberries, but at this point I didn't want more strawberries concerned I would get more of the same.  I asked if I could get either bananas, pineapple or apples.  They had a box for less money with a mix of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, which I was interested in.  She explained they had been so busy over the weekend they had NO fruit.  This was after 12 in the afternoon, surely they should have gotten a delivery and if not for emergencies run to the grocery store right next door.  I said it didn't have to be today but I guess they never expected another delivery of fruit ever again.  She said the only thing she could do was refund the person who paid which was my mother in law.  I hung up and called my mother in law and told her I loved her idea but they were horrible and they would be contacting her for info so they could refund her.  It's now five days later and no one has called her for the refund and I never got anything edible.  They are liars and thieves.

Being 2.5 hours away from Chicago, I am still looking for a great modern America cuisine restaurant that is not simply a steak house. Silvercreek is likely the best that Champaign has to offer, but it still falls short of a 4 or 5 star dining experience in Chicago. As soon as you step into the restaurant, the all brick wall and wood ceiling interior adds a bit of class to your meal. We went in the summer time, but I can imagine how rustic it would feel in the winter with the large fireplaces that are along the adjacent wall. The server was quick to take our orders and get the kids meals out first with the appetizer. We went with the appetizer sampler which had the shrimp cocktail served with blue cheese mousse with cocktail sauce (FYI they serve it in such a weird shot glass that I thought it was an oyster in cocktail sauce....), calamari fried exceptionally well, marinated olives with a sweet zest, and duck prosciutto wrapped dates. It was nice trying a bunch of apps on plate. My duck entree is where it losses some stars as only 3/4 of this was cooked well, the other 1/4 was too well done on the chewy side. The cauliflower and parsnip puree along with the shiitake mushroom roasted cauliflower complemented the dish well especially the freshness of the vegetables. I am also very concern why there was a dark blue discoloration in the duck breast as noted in my picture. The redeeming quality is the extensive options on the menu and some farm to table elements.

Pros: refined menu that utilizes many components to the dish, special dinner menu, Sunday brunch

Cons: What is up with the blue discoloration in the duck breast and 1/4 of it was way over done

Hidden deals:
1. Sunday brunch buffet- I need to come back and give this a try
2. Pre-fixe menu- not advertised on the website 3 course meal for 29.99
3. Global Wednesday- unique foods from around the world
4. Live music Friday night",1,qntQp9UoeP6ju8D_W0Y0cw

There is a small patio, but it was closed due to inclement weather.  When we walked in, we were ignored by the hostess who was reading off her iPad.  I had to grab her attention and she promptly seated us  The interior is quite shabby looking (maybe that is by design).  We were seated upstairs and had an indifferent waitress.  The menu is quite small - literally less than 20 items.  After I inquired if there was a larger dinner menu (it was dinner time), I was told that this is their everyday menu (no separate lunch or dinner menu).  She didn't explain anything about the portion sizes, not even a ""hello"" when she first came by.  All we got, after waiting 10 minutes, ""What do you want to order?""  We thought the tacos came with sides (as they do in most restaurants), but here, they didn't as we saw other patrons' dishes.  It would have been nice to get some explanation of the menu. The tacos themselves are okay taste wise, but small in size.  The ""appetizers"" are actually bigger portions and more expensive than the main dishes (tacos).  We had the Ceviche (nicely presented, but too sweet), chips and guac dip (good), plus we had two types of fish tacos (grilled and fried), one chirizo taco and a grilled chicken taco.  All were good, but they took time to come out.  We felt like getting dessert since our main dishes sizes were so small without any sides, so we asked our wandering waitress for the tiny menus again.  She asked us what we wanted for dessert. We asked to see the menus again and she said ""We only have 4 items."" Then she just told us the four items.  However, because of food allergies, we wanted to see the ingredients on the menu.  She still refused and then said ""What do you need to know, these are regular desserts.""  We were disappointed by her attitude.  We were hungry (due to the tiny tacos), so we ordered churros.  However, due to her attitude and the servers who bring the food (they just slap it down on the table and walk away without any explanation), I took off 2 stars, and 1 star off for the tiny amount of food in comparison to the price.

I dunno, it wasn't all that. 

Located in the Miracle Mile Shops in planet Hollywood, and open all day.  Claim to have ""the worlds best lobster roll"".  I have to disagree, and this is based on taste, type of meat, and possibly luck.  

Maybe I was unlucky to get an off-night lobster roll.  It was filled with claw meat, didn't get too much tail in my roll.  It's very lightly dressed, and while that may be a ploy to say,""we're not going to hide our fresh lobster taste!"" what it ended up doing was make it painfully obvious that the roll was drenched in butter.  Lobster rolls I'm used to are more like lobster salad on bread.  And when I said filled, I didn't mean filled like bursting at the seams, I just meant that's what thye filled my sandwich with.  The bread to lobster meat ratio was something like 3:1, and it was tourist priced as heck, actually everything is here.

My wife got the lobsicle and the lobster ice cream.  I would describe the lobsicle as a split lobster tail tempura skewered and fried.  And the lobster ice cream was just a mild vanilla-ish ice cream with lobster meat.  It was ridiculous, like $5 for a small.  Don't get me wrong, I like weird Filipino ice cream, with corn and with cheese, but this just wasn't for me.  

I'll eat here again maybe, but I probably won't get the lobster roll.  I'd probably just get the lobster and chips, but more likely, I'd save my appetite and my skrilla for Boiling Crab or Hot n Juicy.",1,tQOVsJoOYwoPMIGkkPIfDA

I had just started going here about three weeks ago and the place was starting to grow on me in a weird sort of  way.  The first time I went was for the Tuesday $2 for any draft beer day, and that was pretty good except for the short pour beers which I thought maybe was just a fluke and not an everyday occurence.  Joined their on line club and went back the following week to redeem the free burger coupon you get upon joining.  The server switched my burger with someone elses's and gave us both 1/2 off, so I saved the free burger coupon for next time.  The next (and it turns out the last) time I went was 8/29, because I received a coupon for a $5 burger to celebrate the start of the college football season.  I should have known it was the ""beginning of the end"" when I walked in about 3:15 pm and nobody was behind the bar, and the North Carolina-South Carolina game that they were hyping for the start of college football season was not on any of the many TV's in the place.  After about 5-10 minutes a bartender appeared and I got my usual short pour draft.  I presented the $5 coupon and ordered a burger which came out way more done than the medium I ordered.  Was too hungry to complain but when the bill came they had applied my free burger credit from the on-line membership  that I was saving instead of the $5 coupon I had presented.  The manager said he couldn't re-load the free burger credit to my card, so he hand wrote a card ""good for any sandwich or burger"" that I could use on a future visit and commented how instead of getting a $5 burger today, I got a free one and still had a free one coming.  Like I said, this place was starting to grow on me because of all of their rather comical screw-ups.

Mesa, AZ 85202

Having never eaten Salvadoran food before, I decided to try it, and am so glad that I did. This is totally different than Mexican food.

This is a relatively small restaurant, with a tiny kitchen, but don't let the size fool you - that tiny kitchen turns out some wonderful food. I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico.

The waitress brought my drink along with a nice, crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify, but which gave it a nice flavor. Service is a little slow, but I attribute that to the fact that every dish is cooked to order - no steam tables here.

Next, was the main course. I ordered the Lengua Guisada ($9.95). Nice, big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce, served with rice that had veggies in it, and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten. Instead of being crisp and crunchy, these were firm on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. For the more adventurous, there is also hot sauce on the table. The flavors were all wonderful, and I used the corn tortillas to mop up all of the sauce on the plate. I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot.

I had to try the Pupupas, which are stuffed corn tortillas which are then grilled. I tried two different ones, and although I was entitled to get rice and bean with them, I opted not to have them because I was already getting full. The first Pupupas was stuffed with shrimp and cheese, and had a lovely texture and flavor. They have a tomato based sauce on the table that you can slather on your Pupupas if you so desire. I found that it really augmented the flavor and ended up using it on both Pupupas. The second Pupupas was shredded pork and cheese, and while tasty, wasn't up to the flavor profile of the camerones.

Unfortunately, by this time I was stuffed and had no more room to try anything else, but I will be back to try some more. Next time I want to try the Sopa de Pata/Mondongo, which is a hearty soup of heart and beef tripe, along with the Ensalada de Camarones Asados, which is a grilled shrimp salad.

It's hard to leave here hungry - you really would have to work at it!

Sanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware. They also will modify menu items to make them vegetarian.

I give them 4 stars for a really tasty meal that was muy authentico.",0,SCYd8BnpdTCoGIFUIw_SWA

PcNoyeR7lyt3KbIyIICTuA,0,2014-03-27 18:17:27,0,oQ_ZQMTi2vxHr-EHyOovdA,"I was a patient in this dentistry for about 3 years and I have mixed review about the place.
Good thing: Both the doctor (Dr. fuller) and the office stuffs were very nice and helpful. I don't have an insurance so the cheaper price compared to some other places helped me a lot. Being a regular patient, I had several X-rays done without a charge. The office is very clean, waiting times were moderate. 
I had few fillings, one root canal, and one wisdom tooth extraction done here and my experiences were comfortable. The extraction had some kind of complication (the tooth won't come out) so Dr. Fuller explained to me that he is going to grind the tooth inside my mouth and then take it out, so I might hear some grinding noise inside my mouth. Although I was supposed to feel scared, I somehow found it funny and to be honest didn't feel anything. 
The root canal experience too was very good. I read a lot about how sometime it can be painful but have to say I didn't feel a thing (not even the pinching of nerve that everyone talks about).
Only thing I have to say about both the procedure is that no one explained to me  what to expect AFTER the procedure was done. I wanted to ask,  but didn't feel like speaking once half of my mouth was numb. I remember I had lot of bleeding the evening after my extraction and had no idea what to do or wheather it was normal to bleed. I was not in a condition to even call and ask. I had to go online find remedies like pressing a wet tea bag etc. 

The main reason I had to change dentistry is because I was suggested two more possible  root canals 6 months after the first one. I don't think I had the best set of teeth in the world but three root canals in a year sounded little strange to me. Especially when I didn't have any sensitivity to heat and cold or a tooth ache for that matter. I decided for a second opinion and in fact went to three other dentists to confirm... they all said I only needed fillings for those two.
Anyways, for procedures like filling etc and for someone who is sure that he/she needs a root canal, I would recommend this place.",2,EQi3XCUOGH00jVsGLDtdXA

Perhaps good reason for it; the provenance makes Guadalaraja, Mexico the place of origin (having done business there for enough years we genuinely believe the history), and even in other parts of Mexico it is not easy to find. But we are starting to see the sandwich show up on some Las Vegas menus, and we have to give a shout-out to El Birotazo for making the best that we have found so far.

Torta Ahogada literally means ""drowned sandwich"". Roast pork in a salty bollilo (the latter preferrably just a bit stale), dipped into a spicy chile arbol-based sauce. Add some pickled onions and a squeeze of lime. A fantastic combination if the meat is roasted properly and the bread sturdy enough to have a little staying power (especially if eaten from a cart in Guadalaraja).

El Birotazo does it right. The owners are from Guadalajara and take a lot of pride in their product. Generous with the meat, and the bread is crusty and has just enough oomph to get about two-thirds of the way through before it collapses. But no problem - they serve it in a shallow plate with a spoon, so that you can enjoy to the last drop. As for the rest of the small menu, we do not have a clue - all trips have been for this sandwich, and it is difficult to think about taking any other direction.",4,UXmddgoTzmOZAZTaZf_efA

~The Good~
The vegetable selection is out of this world. So many varieties, its hard to list them all. They offer Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) at the lowest prices in the valley. LOVE IT! So many different cabbages, and so on...I could go on and on. The meat selection looks good as well, especially the seafood, which has a ton of different fishes. The sake and Asian wine selections is also really cool, right above the frozen food beds filled with yummy frozen seafood.  The noodle and rice section, as expected, is overwhelming and filled with great choices. The sauces section is also huge, you forget sometimes how many sauces are featured in Asian cooking. Finally, I do not eat any baked goods normally, but the bakery looks really good. If I did eat treats on a normal basis, I'd come here.

~The Bad~
With the good comes the bad, especially the unsightly open tanks filled with the fish and seafood. It smells ""interesting"" in the meat/seafood section, hence the reason I usually do not get anything there. The fish are almost always sold whole....I prefer pre-cut, personally. I also do have a hard time with the sheer enormity of all the goods, most of them without much descriptions. I really have to do my homework either WHILE shopping or BEFORE shopping, or I will be buying something I have no clue about. It is an adventure, shopping here, nonetheless.

~The Down Low~
This place really is a 3.5 out of 5. 2 stars go out for the sheer amount of specialty Asian foods to select from, and another for the sake/beer selection....more than anywhere else in the valley. A 1/2 star goes out to the seafood selection, omitting some stars for the previously discussed issues I have with the meat/seafood section.

Feel free to ask me for my ID but I expect the conversations to be peaceful. I'm not entirety sure why the security guards think there job is to be tough and mean to the guests and not just protect them. Either way I brought a couple grand with me down tonight for some fun on the tables and it looks like I will be finding a different casino to play at.,0,075Ni8NWrZ1TDv1u4k_xPw

I wanted to return merchandise and I didn't have the actual receipt in front of me, but had the transactions from my card. I had bought over $800 on a work trip 2 weeks prior with no time to try them on, had planned on bringing them back. 

I spent 90minutes in the store and was in hold with customer service for 25min on hold until they hung up on me without ever getting to talk to someone. 

The store manager said to email customer service, but they told me they don't deal with stores and sent me back to the store.

Long story short, the store took back my merchandise but never gave me store credit or my money back. Is that legal? 

Yes the clothes are beautiful at a great price, but all they want is your money and don't care about screwing customers over.",1,oVswGR73HLi_UfNC4Ut0dA

If you order Szechuan you get different items than if you order mixed vegetables with your choice of sauce. It would help if they just listed this in the description of the item vs. you having to guess. We ended up getting Szechuan chicken and Chicken with mixed vegetables and hot garlic sauce. We ordered fried rice instead of white rice. This didn't meet the $25 minimum for delivery, so we got an order of wonton soup. We got our confirmation e-mail saying it would be 10-15 minutes and they didn't disappoint. Our food arrived on time and it was hot. Both chicken dishes were good and the fried rice was really good.

The hostess greets us and tells us it would be a few minutes for her to set up the table. We wait and then she takes us back. Our server was already waiting at our table and we noticed that nothing had been done to them to accommodate our big group. The two tables were still separated down the middle and we were supposed to split up. (Four on each side) 

I tell him no that we would like to sit together. He says ""okay"" and so we actually help him move the tables together.. He takes our drink orders and and brings them out right away. 

We tell him we are ready to order and so he writes the orders all down..

Salmon with a loaded potato soup and green beans

Grilled chicken breast w a potato soup and mashed potatoes 

Two orders of Tri tip steak with loaded baked potatos and french fries

Two orders of pork chops with broccoli and green beans

Two orders of a rib eye steak (one with rice and potatoes and the other was a salad and baked potato)

Kids cheeseburger sliders. Kids meal comes with a scoop of ice cream!

Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout! For being a big group, he made sure to always keep our drinks refilled and made sure we were doing okay. 

My sister n law actually found a long piece of hair deep into her salad. She told the server right away and he kindly brought us out a new one. Other then finding that long hair, the food was great. 

The cookie my Dad was given for his bday was SO good! Sign up for their rewards club as you can get yourself a free meal (valued up to $21 I believe) for your birthday!

My whisky sour was made well (no sour mix, fresh lemon) and my wife's latte was excellent. We ordered a slice of tiramisu for the heck of it; it came with a whipped cream pouf and a coffee bean on top. The next day I was at Costco with my wife and she was looking at the cakes and guess what was there? The exact same tiramisu cake with the little puff and coffee bean on top. The cake was something like $12 in costco and we paid I think $8 or $10 for a small slice. Kind of put me off from returning to the Beaconsfield to be honest.

Worth the 20 minute wait in the sun, with the Virgin mobile tent blasting the latest whatever in my ear, especially when they called my name and I opened the brown Naaco box to reveal chickpea fritters wrapped in a gluten free pita and a generous helping of mogo chips (cassava chips, I think?). I dusted some citrus salt on there and dug in. It was filling without being heavy, the fritters were crunchy on the outside, soft inside and the toppings were really fresh. They were out of iced tea but we did get a s'moresa for dessert, a samosa filled with callebaut chocolate and chai spice, which was delicious, covering our faces with powered sugar. 
All in all, some great truck food at a good price. In the growing sea of food trucks in yyc, Naaco is a real stand out.",3,08Xn4j6XGnqdrXRmGx0TrQ

My dinner there was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Both the quality of the service and of the food were superb.  I have to give a special shout out to our waiter, Paco, who took really great care of us all night especially when we weren't unsure about what to order.

Since we had a large group, I got to try several things on the menu.  The Braised Short Ribs were hands down one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  This dish alone is worth 5 stars.  The meat was so tender, moist and juicy that I could easily cut it with my fork like a hot knife through butter.  The fois gras was also amazingly good.  My condolences to the duck or goose.  I also recommend the escargots.  How can you not like anything cooked in butter?  I was not a very big of of the veal though.  A bit too dry.

The price of these services are not cheap, but let me tell you they are worth it (though the Groupon definitely offset the cost by quite a bit, I would still return and pay full price). 

I was the only person in the small nail salon with one nail technician who was actually the manager. We had a great time chatting about lots of things while completing my service. I was also offered a glass of wine, coffee, or tea when I arrived. It's these little touches that make spending the money and time at a place of this caliber worth it. 

My gel manicure was well done and I liked the selection of colors. I really liked the recliner chairs for the pedicures and the fact that they use bowl liners for each client for hygiene purposes. The manager also explained to me their sterilization process of their equipment. 

I spent close to 3 hours getting my services and I loved every minute of it. It was relaxing and we'll done and 3 weeks later both my finger and toenail polishes are intact, though I need to make a follow up appointment for the grow out!

Even though the trail crosses several major roads the trail is very quiet and relaxing as it cuts through residential neighborhoods. Each major road has an underground path so that you don't have to cross busy roads. I was glad to find this option as it seems like a much safer way to travel the path. 

The path was free of garbage and animal waste. We saw volunteers cleaning up the area close to the wash as we walked too.

When we entered the hostess greeted us and let us know to wait a couple of minutes while an outside table was being cleared. A minute later she lead us to the table that overlooked the pool and handed us the menus. 

Very small breakfast/lunch menu. I ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich (sub. the fried eggs for egg whites) and asked for fruit instead of fried potatoes. And lots of coffee. 

Cheechee was our sever and he was fabulous! Very accommodating and always checked on my coffee mug and water. They never went empty. He made small talk about 4th of July and asked about our stay. 

After about 20 minutes the food arrived. The sandwich was an average portion, made the way I had requested but the bacon was mainly all fat. I had to take half the bacon out which left the sandwich a little wimpy. 

Prices are high for what the food is worth and portion. The sandwich was $14.00,  hub's red velvet waffle was $14.00 and regular brewed coffee was $4.00. After tax  and tip was close to $40.00.

oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ,0,2015-01-03,0,py7Tm3YVLmHhu1YYm9K5og,"I went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance. It was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tip...before wine. 

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was ""crispy ricotta gnocchi."" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

(also, I'm not sure how to change my profile but I'm no longer vegan, heh)",3,s3RzG1bQ4Srk9UjUB6W89w

The food was definitely high quality food but the portions are so small you will likely leave hungry.  The service was not good (understandable/training) and the atmosphere was very cold and unwelcoming.  I had the rainbow trout appetizer, the chicken breast roast for main course and the tiramisu desert.

My sister took me here on my last day in Montreal to have ""proper"" poutine. Poutineville has all kinds! I settled on the house poutine which came with cheese curds (duh), braised beef in wine sauce, and gravy. Man, talk about rich! My sister and I also shared a goat cheese salad to try and cut the richness of the poutine. Canadians eat this as a main entr√©e? I guess it's really no different than chili cheese fries but then again, I never eat that as a main either but I know some folks do.

The highlight for me here was actually one of their desserts - the Gateau fromage Bailey's Irish Cream (aka Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake). This was one of THE best desserts I've ever had in my life. The crust was light and crumbly, the center, rich but not too rich and the milk chocolate shavings balanced it all beautifully. I have had dreams about this dessert since.

Poutineville is a chain so there a various locations throughout Quebec...You can't come to here and not try poutine. When in Rome, people...",3,UH6RCH9K1o2VW3CU8PY5iQ

The Belgian Waffle and BBQ Pork Ribs was the dish of choice.  Waffles and Ribs for Breakfast?  We were in heaven!  I've told others of this combo and even showed them our photos.  They were disgusted and said that was the most unhealthy breakfast they'd ever heard of.  How can 4 smoked baby back ribs be worse for you than say 4 link sausages or 4 slices of bacon, both of which are fried?  Although the meat didn't fall off the bone, the ribs were tender.  I wasn't fond of the sauce, it was a little too tangy for my taste. (see photo)

The fresh apple mini fritters were also a hit.  They're fried fresh to order, served hot, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  (see photo)

We also had the chicken and mushroom scramble.  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onion, fontina + cream cheese.  It was good, but definately not my favorite of the three, and I probably wouldn't order it again.

As for getting to the restaurant, you have to make a turn in at an intersection and drive a bit through a plaza to get up front but they have time sensitive parking for take out right in front which is really convenient. I was greeted immediately at the take out counter and my order was already packed up and ready to go. It was a really quick in and out process. If I had to critique anything it's that the fries get a little soggy because they leave the take out containers inside a warming bag so if you want your fries crispy, you should probably eat in or opt for a different side. The containers themselves are actually vented so you're good on that front. Also I think the sauce is a little more watery than I remember which makes it a little harder to get the maximum amount of delicious sauce onto my chicken and into my mouth.

When we walked in, we had to wait 10 minutes wondering where our waitress/hostess was.

About another 10 minutes later, we were finally guided to our table where we waited 33 minutes to have the waitress come back to take our orders. When the food finally arrived, we rapidly asked for ranch which we asked when we placed our order, but apparently they had forgotten. Long story short, we waited over 20 minutes waiting on our ranch, and had to ask THREE different waitresses. By the time someone finally brought ranch, we were done with our food.

The eggs were cooked way more than I had wanted but were decent. The grits were totally flavorless. The black beans were my favorite, they were good.

The burger was very juicy and delicious (especially because of the egg yolk) but also very messy! If you go to this place make sure you're going on an empty stomach because the burgers are very filling. I actually had to take my fries to-go because I was too full from the burger

I think next time I'd get the burger without the bacon. Honestly, the bacon tasted good but it was really hard/chewy and when I took a bite of the bacon I couldn't break it apart and it ended up ripping my burger apart. Also next time I'd probably ask for extra tomato just because it was a little overwhelming to be eating a beef patty, bacon and egg all in one bite. 

This place gets busy very quickly so if you go during a weekend at lunch time, don't expect a table because it was completely full when I went today.

And then when they can't sell it in the case they throw it all in the grinder and call it something else. Yuck.
Very misleading Groupon that states Hobe Prime Beef. What that means is that you HAVE to buy the prime beef to use the Groupon. After they mark up the Prime your Groupn is worthless and the owner was very unaccommodating about using it for what I actually came in to buy.
It's pretty clear that Hobe has all of the lure and attraction of an old time butcher with many of the same games too.

When I initially saw that this was on Spring Mountain road, I automatically thought it was going to be relatively close to Chinatown. But it's not. It's a good distance further down, if you're thinking about checking it out.

The food court area is decent for Vegas, but nothing memorable if you're used to good Korean food in the LA/OC area. There are 5 food court stalls, and each has a distinct personality with a Korean flair. Some have a Japanese, Hawaiian, or Chinese twist to their food. We chose the most Korean of them all, called Noodle Village.

We ordered the seafood pancake, kimchi dumpings, and the fried chicken. The prices will make you cringe a bit, especially for a food court. The total for the 3 dishes was about $30. The people working there were extremely friendly too. But I have to be honest, all three dishes had some major flaws. 

The seafood pancake barely had any seafood, and if there were, they were microscopic. It also consisted of about 30% green onions. The kimchi dumplings, while enormous in size, were still cold in the middle. While awesome to look at, I think the dumplings are best served half their size. I splurged on the fried chicken, because the picture looked really tempting, with that ultra-crispy, golden exterior. But once in person, the batter was sort of mushy in a way, and not crunchy at all. The meat inside was moist and juicy, but it was very bland too.",6,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g

My personal disdain for this particular one comes from the horrible drive-thru correct completion ratio (#DTCCR). They have gotten our order correct MAYBE 5% of the time, with a statistically significant number of visits. REALLY.

Tonights order 4 items= 2 Taco Salads-minus rice. One Pintos Cheese w/ green not red sauce. Steak Enchirito. 2 Drinks.

Salads came thru window fast, and intact (no rice - yay!). 2 drinks followed, with one straw (boo). Second bag was pulled before coming thru window because it contained a large number of items (car behind us?). Second bag came thru - pintos, check. Enchirito, check.

Got home - pintos with green? Nope. Red. Enchirito steak? Negative Ghost Rider. 

6 items+2 straws = 8 things to hand us. 2 of them wrong, and no straw. 5 outta 8 just isn't a good percentage. Bonus points for window girl for realizing she had wrong bag and grabbing 2nd bag ""on the fly"". Negative points for substituting incorrect items for other incorrect items.

Me, my fianc√©, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fianc√© paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fianc√©s mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

This is one of the newer resort casinos in the Valley with an updated casual feel. It is comfortable, clean and has a great vibe. You can come in with casual wear as it is not stuffie... It's comfie! GVR is adjacent to The District, which is full of great shops and other restaurants. It is easily reached off the 215 fwy and has a lot of parking. If you cannot find parking in the front, remember there is a multi-level parking structure in the back.

I've been here for 4th of July a couple times and it's a great place to watch fireworks. There is also a movie theatre down stairs, so if you are in for a pizza and movie...GVR is the place!",7,quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw

I don't eat shell fish, and while I liked most of what I ate, you just can't eat enough omelettes and potatoes for brunch to be worth $60, even with bottomless mimosas.  The ambiance is beautiful and they have any and everything you could want to eat (asian, italian, mexican, american, meats and of course seafood).  There was a lot, but I'll tell you what I thought of the things I ate:

Pork belly - delicious, rich, have more than 1 if you love pork like I do

Noodle soup - choice of ramen, pho, udon, etc.  the pho was ok, but not amazing

Sushi - good, not great and not a huge amount of selection

Omelettes - made to order and delicious.  You can even get some shell fish and give it to the chef to put in your omelette

American fried food - waffle fries, onion rings, and such were a little too salty, and not cooked frequently enough to be fresh and hot out of the fryer

Breakfast potatoes - meh, not crispy, not seasoned well

Fruit - yummy and delicious and fresh

Crepes - a star of the breakfast buffet and also made to order with lots of toppings

My friend eats shellfish and she filled up on crab legs, oysters, clams and all the other shellfish she wanted, so it was worth the price for her.  However, she did say that it was all over-salted, which made it just ok and not great.

Unexpectedly, the line was about half as long as previously endured (both times on a Tuesday evening), getting in the spirit was a lot easier than anticipated.

However, as we drove through the town (with half the cars forgetting to turn their lights off, boooo) I was a little saddened by how identical it was.

This way, we still got to enjoy the amazingness that it is, while experiencing other restaurants as well. The service was decent, nothing really to write home about. But! Next time we will make sure we are there for happy hour (2-6, M-F), which looked like an awesome deal.

First, the beer list. I'm sure everyone has mentioned it in as many reviews as they have. So many beers. Mostly local. Always rotating. So many types and breweries and lions and tigers and bears, oh my!

Second, the fries. I was skeptical (I mean, they're FRIES), and the hubs isn't even a fan of fries. So when the called them ""crack fries,"" I set myself up to be disappointed. I was not. Plus, they bring them out with a delectably creamy cheese sauce. If there isn't crack in them, I'm legitimately surprised. My advice would be to get the ones that DON'T come with stuff on them already. Part of the joy of these fries is their delightful crispiness, and I would hate to ruin that by making them soggy.

Our second appetizer arrived (because two people definitely need to eat two appetizers), and it somehow met and exceeded our lofty expectations after the fries. Fried pretzel balls. Gooey cheese sauce. Bacon. Jalape√±os. Onions. No, that is not a list of the foods I could survive on. That's reality. That is the Loaded Pretzel Nuggz.

Finishing off the night, we ordered the BLT and the chicken wings. Both were awesome (there could have been a tiny bit more wing sauce and it could have used a little bit more of a kick).

This is their main location and you'll notice the cook house in the rear of the parking lot. They still cook their BBQ on site, I think they still use wood but not positive about that . Troutman's is an old family run business and has been serving BBQ for many years. The provided a heaping sandwich which was very tasty. The slaw was good and my bun was toasted. I had two sandwiches and tea for $8.51. The service was good and the food was good too. The building could use some updating but it's a good place to stop in and taste BBQ the way it should be served.

BBQ education; there are two NC styles of BBQ: 

Eastern mostly whole hogs slow cooked over wood and sometimes gas and served with Brunswick stew (beef and chicken with vegetables), slaw (either yellow or red), corn bread (either hush puppies or corn bread sticks), white small potatoes or fries. The sauce is usually vinegar based with some added spices especially red peppers. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled. 

The other mostly in western NC is usually pork shoulders either slow cooked over wood or gas. Gas is becoming a popular fuel to conserve wood and the air quality. The wood adds some great flavor and many people don't want it any other way. Pork shoulders are smaller cuts of meat and cook in less time. The cooked meat usually is served with a mayonnaise based slaw, fries or on a sandwich. If you order a basket or tray you usually just get BBQ and hush puppies. If you order a plate you get fries and probably a side of slaw. The sides can certainly vary... so ask. The sauce is usually thick and red, based with ketchup some added spices especially red peppers and vinegar. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled.
 
Many area restaurants now offer BBQ Chicken and beef brisket (mostly a Texas dish) along with pork spare ribs and beef ribs too. These items are not typically found with true NC family BBQ establishments... mostly the larger ones trying the satisfy more people with their offerings. 

Since Concord and Charlotte are in the middle of the state... you will find both types here.",2,b_3AWll3wtidFQO76om8YQ

Sure enough, after an admirable experience with Buster's Sea Cove during the VELD Music Festival, I decided to go there again, especially after hearing great reviews.

I decided to get the grilled octopus after pressuring and recommendation from one of the employees. It came with either fries or salad (I went with caesar salad). I got about four BIG pieces of octopus on top of the caesar salad.

Portion wise I was definitely happy considering I paid a total of just over $18 with a drink, as I initially thought it would be a bit of a ripoff. In fact, I didn't even finish the salad, that's how filling it was. The octopus was definitely one of the best ones I've had ever, and it didn't even need to be fried, since fried stuff is usually tastier.

This location can be tough to spot as it is tucked away in a little plaza. The interior is dark and you'll need to order up at the counter, take a number and seat yourself. 

According to my friends from Hong Kong, this is how it is back at home. The grungy atmosphere with TVs playing old drama and elderly folks reading the newspaper. 

I ordered wontons with instant noodles with an additional order of egg sandwiches ($1.50 extra). This combo came with the milk tea for a total of $6.75 plus tax. 

The milk tea is rich and creamy - I can definitely taste the award winning feature of this drink. I will be trying the iced version next time!

So it's around 4am (and NO I was not drunk!) There were five of the six girls that stuck with me after Haze. Some wanted chinatown, some wanted steak & eggs.. We ended up here because our heels were killing us, haha.

Anyway! It took us a while to find the entrance, but since we went up the escalators after Haze we saw people that were sitting in the caf√©. We walked through the back & the servers quickly told us that we went the wrong way. They directed us to the host stand, where the hostess was PRETENDiNG to be busy & clean menus. We apologized to her & tried joking around but she never lifted her head or looked at us until somebody else sat us, which was a good 3-4 minutes. Believe me people, I have been a hostess for a solid two years at a fine dining restaurant that offers late night menu on the weekends until 2am & I've had my share of working with those RUDE hostesses that are purposely give attitude or can't do your job & greet your guests. I believe that you should try to act as professional as you can, no matter how late it is or how crappy your day/night is (sorry mini rant! lol). Other than the stupid hostess, our server was perfectly fine.

The caf√© is very modern & spacious. The utensils were awesome, I wanted to take them home & blow bubbles with them! The round table we had was against the wall in the left side of the restaurant. Some of the tables in the middle of the caf√© were set higher & it almost reminded me of a fancy library :P It could be a bad thing, but I thought just about everything in the restaurant looked neat. 

Three of the girls ordered omelets, eggs benedict, philly cheesesteak (looked tasty btw) & I ordered the oriental chicken salad. The salad was a good amount for $15, I ended up taking it home because it was too much for me at 4am haha. The bill for five people was $86, so I would say most of the items in the menu are $13-20. It was what I was expecting because it is on the strip & we couldn't decide on where to eat anyway :) I'll probably be back again late at night to try out that cheesesteak! yum yum",1,VomrqwTbz1hxmZpL69u5XQ

GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,1,2011-09-01 17:53:54,3,N2Ebrv3lCMLglYvGTfFwNA,"Ok I need to preface this review by saying a couple of things.  First, it was a larger group, second there were two and then a few more potentially buzzed/intoxicated members of the party and three we were all really tired from traveling all day and setting up for a trade show.  OK preface done!

Not being a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas area, honestly its just too much for a simpleton like myself, when I am there it is generally for business and/or trade shows.  I got a call from one of my friends to meet up with her and have some dinner at this great restaurant at the Venetian, B&B.  Learning that it was one of Mario Bitali's restaurants and a fan of Italian wine (oh yeah BTW I am a wine maker) I was quite excited!!

We get there, table is not ready nor are all of our party so we head to the bar.  Drinks ordered .... Negroni consumed.  Probably the best Negroni I have ever had!  Tick tock, still waiting for the rest of our party.  Now with most everyone here they seat us.  Realizing that they did not have enough seats at the table we informed the waitstaff.  Once the balance of our party arrived at the table still without the needed seating the manager came over rather gruff and threw up his arms and walked away muttering not so sweet nothings under his breath.  But I do need to qualify that statement by saying that are late companions were feeling the side effects of drinking Vodka Tonics.  

We order the wine, sans any real help the Sommelier other than ""yeah were are out of that one but if you like Barbera there are more on page so-and-so"".  Gee thanks guy.  

Our waiter was a bubbly guy who reminded me more of a mad scientist from an old western movie with his big moustache and insane enthusiasm for his job and food.  He takes the orders and assists where he can.  Being sure to compliment us on our orders (I dont understand that move) and briskly rushes back to the waiter cave and put the orders in the hopper.

Tick tock, tick tock waiting for apps to arrive.  Tick tock.  I know that the Molto Mario Empire want the world to experience the way that Italy eats but when you are with a group with some members who are more the burger king crowd one would think that the staff would adjust their schedules to turn the table.  Oh well.

Apps arrive, good - not great - good.  One not so good dish but our enthusiastic waiter fixed the situation.  

Wine is running low ....... Mr Sommelier where are you.  Oh there you are, gliding in and out of the room looking down your nose at all the tables.  Um we would like our wine now please.  But you keep walking by ignoring us.  Sure we are a big group, sure we are talking and having a good time but no need to ignore us. Hey man not all of the public are ignorant.  Oh yeah I also like how you take two oz pours to check for tainting.  I wonder how the person buying the $1400.00 Super Tuscan feels when they see you taking $80 out of their bottle?

So before we could contain our now intoxicated friend walks to the wine station grabs our bottles and briskly brings them to the table.  Now everyone on staff is aghast with jaws on the floor and the look of ""I cant believe that fat guy just did that"" written all over their faces.  Oh bother, great now we are going to have issues.  Surprisingly no one said anything, the waiter simply brought a bottle trivet over to protect the already stained table.

Tick tock, tick tock.  Secondi would be nice.  Ah there is our enthusiastic waiter again, lets ask him.  ""They are plating them right now""!  Yippie!!!  Plates arrive.  Again good - not great - good.  Steaks are chewy and medium rare became very rare somehow and the polenta crusted sweet breads were interesting to say the least.  Something about raw polenta and cooked polenta as a crust for sweet breads does not work for me.  Maybe I dont get it?  

Exhausted with the evening we decide to skip dessert and just get the heck out of dodge.

All in all the dining experience was OK.  Perhaps a smaller crowd, perhaps a more refined crowd, perhaps a less intoxicated crowd?  Either way, its Vegas!  People drink and there are large crowds.  Maybe, as I stated earlier, the staff should recognize when they should rush a table out and not stick to the corporate dining model?  

To the waiter and the water/bread waitress .... you are saints for dealing with certain elements of our table.  To the management , relax.   To Mr Sommelier, people skills go a long way and maybe it is time to not take yourself so seriously.

Would I be back ..... maybe but keep it small and simple and dont come with high expectations.",2,wexuWioPIJ4hcFaxrJLJjw

It's nice to finally have a 'green gym' that is equipped with energy-saving and eco-friendly equipment.  I'm happy to see more gyms/business that are becoming more socially responsible and taking on these green initiatives.

The gym itself is equipped with top of the line equipment and I am very impressed by the variety of fitness classes offered.  I did my first ever TRX class there and definitely felt the burn the next day. I'm excited to get started on a regular TRX routine because it definitely works and is fun too. The weights area is very clean and open.  I always shy away from some of the bigger gym franchises as they are often overcrowded and you spend most of your time waiting for equipment instead of working out.  

You really get the sense that it's 'your' gym...change the channel on the TVs, turn up the music, crank up the A/C, the owner is very accommodating and keeps the members happy.

I am SO EMBARRASSED that I told my guests to stay there. They arrived over the course of 3 days, and NONE of their rooms were ready when they got there, regardless of time or date.

As the bride, this was very upsetting. So was the incompetence we encountered with our own room. We stayed at TI for 10 days, and had booked 2 back-to-back reservations. The front desk said we would have to check out and check back in. (Annoying, but not a huge deal.) However, someone forgot to make a note of this because 3 different maids barged in and told me I had to leave since it was past check out...for the room I was in for 5 more days. Then they accused us of stealing a duvet, going so far as to charge my husband's card...while we were still in the room, sleeping under the duvet.

As it was our wedding, I got my hair and makeup done at the spa. Rude, rude, rude!!!!!! Overpriced, and overcharged. I had 3 services at the spa, and all 3 ""professionals"" made fun of me. ON MY WEDDING DAY. To make matters worse, they overcharged me. When they called to tell me about the overcharge, they noted that I had been in for bridal services but that I would have to come back in that same day (my WEDDING DAY) with my credit card to get my refund. If I waited 'til the next day, I forfeited the refund.

Fast forward, after the wedding. We're hungry. The room service menu was missing, and the TV menu didn't work. We had to pick up a dining menu at the desk, because nothing is open late in the hotel. (On a Friday night. In Vegas. No, no one wants food after midnight in Vegas, right?) We call room service, and they LAUGHED at us and said ""oh no, that menu is out of date.""

As for the other restaurants, the best place is the deli. The Coffee Shop is disgusting and terribly slow, and The Buffet is so overpriced it makes the already gross food taste even worse. Khotan looks nice, but tastes mediocre. Gilley's is fun and actually has decent food, and Canter's Deli is probably the best food and price anywhere around the hotel.

All around, every staff member (with the exception of the catering department, who were phenomenal) was rude, bored, annoyed and just plain unhelpful. Treasure Island scrapes the bottom of the barrel for help, and it shows. It is unbelievable to me that they can charge as much as they do for such a low-quality stay and service. Spend a little more and stay anywhere else on the strip. Or spend a lot less for the same ""quality"" of service somewhere else.",7,CsozyO80UuEEFfgqnBIlCA

Not sure if it was because of my status with Hilton or simply the fact that I was in Vegas but the room I got was a huge 1 bedroom apartment with a full granite-stainless steel kitchen, a rainfall shower big enough for the starting line of a basketball team and a 5 person marble jacuzzi (in the bedroom).

Getting home and putting my feet up would be an understatement. 

The staff better be getting paid well because they consistently went above and beyond.

Gotta go there at least once a year.

The only Nepalese resto in town (used to be, haven't heard of any others opening) - so it's interesting to compare the flavours to some of the north Indian tastes in Little India.

Stay away from the stinky traditional Nepalese thing in the veggie combo - even some of the waiters say they can't stand the taste/smell - kinda like you imagine sweaty sneakers would taste. 

Overall, a really nice addition to the Annex when it opened.  Still a reliable place for a pleasant meal in a clean resto.

The design is in soft greenish-blues and my favorite colors. I couldn't pass this place up with a variety of specials that they offer. I was initially lured in from the advertisement with Harkin's Theater to save your movie ticket for 20 % off at Yogurtini.  They also have Happy Hour specials: Monday through Friday, 11am to 2 pm get a 16 ounce froyo for $4! (Regular price .42 cents per ounce.)

BTW Thank you Yogurtini for allowing your customers to try out flavors on their own vs. having them get a flavor you want (that's a total turn off and I don't visit those froyo shops.)

This place is kept clean and they apparently have over 90 toppings?!??!?!!!! INSANITy!! Great for other patrons, since I never top mine off. I just prefer it as is. I did like their ""cake batter, plain and blueberry""! Super YUM! This place is next to Elevate coffee house, so it's extra special to hang out on a Friday night when they have their live music. Double your pleasure for sure!

The 4 members of my party went out for burgers on a Saturday night. Shortly after 7, we arrived to small half empty dining room. The atmosphere reminds of an Italian cafe - I thought it didnt fit the burger concept.  The tables and chairs are made of wood. In the back of the restaurant stands an open kitchen - so there is not much of a back of the house. 

The menu offers about 6 burgers and a number of sandwiches. There are a few salad options to cater to the vegetarians as well. The menu offerings remind of another burger place in Vegas called Holsteins. They offer similar burger combinations and boozy milkshakes. The menu states that burgers are made of prime rib meat and chuck and those products are ground in house. 

For this visit, the service was great. We had 2-3 individuals servicing the table. 
Our milkshakes and salads arrived first. The Caesar Salad was not spectacular but it was of great size. The price was $6. The salad was soggy with the amount of dressing it came pre tossed in. The croutons were typical store bought. I wouldn't order it next time. The Kale Thai Peanut salad looked ok. 

I ordered the 21st century burger. Average at best. The burger patty temp was hot and prepared as requested. It looks they cook their burgers on a flat tap which typically leaves them much greasier in my opinion.  I order the artisan Brioche bun. The flavor of the burger was ok just very greasy. 

We also ordered an onion ring tower - $9 WAY overpriced but it was good. It comes with about 6 HUGE onion rings and dipping sauces. I thought the rings were OK - standard - but did feel that price was too high. 

I gave this place 2 stars. There are a TON of burger places on the strip. I have been to about a dozen of them. This place doesn't quite compare to others on the strip. The price is expensive for what you get and the quality at some of the places is far better. This restaurant also lacks atmosphere.  The staff is here is very friendly and attentive however.",4,9-7sORMHZXNt11JMZqnrdw

Here is what we ordered:

Kobe beef carpaccio- OMG WIN! WIN! WIN! The beef was thin and delicious covered in truffle oil, parmesean, and arugula. The portion was really large. I am sorry that I didn't just order 5 plates of this for myself instead of the steak trio...I would have been much happier.

Rare Steak Trio for Two - the trio consists of a filet mignon, new york strip, and kobe hangar steak. We ordered the steaks medium rare but only the filet was cooked properly...we had to kick back the NY and hangar. The filet was like butter and really delicious. It took a ridiculously long time to get our other 2 steaks back. They eventually arrived at the correct temperature but the hangar steak was inedible because it was so stringy and tough.

Rare 120 Herbed Fries - good fries covered in chives, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought us out a trio of mini desserts (german chocolate cake, brownie smores,  and tiramisu) with candles on top which was very nice.

Our server was very friendly, attentive, and professional. The manager came out and apologized about the steaks. Best part of the evening was that they were showing the movie Flashdance on the wall.

I've been here a few times in the past, and today I wanted to try something other than the pasta. We were put on the list for a 20 minute wait, which I thought was reasonable, as the place seemed pretty packed for lunch. No biggie.

Got our seats easily within the quoted time, and sat down and ordered a round. We got our beers very quickly, and also were brought waters without asking, which was nice. Our waiter did not seem like he brought his ""A"" game, or even his ""B"" game today, as placing our order seemed forced and uncomfortable. We waited about 15 minutes for our food, which I think was pretty normal, as there were three calzones, and one sandwich. The food was fantastic, and when we asked for more marinara, the waiter brought us some right away.

When the check came, the waiter simply dropped off what looked like the check and immediately left. About 5 minutes later he came back and we asked for him to split the check. He took the check over to the bartender, and had the bartender split it, which I thought was rather strange, and looked very upset about having to split the check. Another 5 minutes, and we got the separate checks back. I got up to get my own box while waiting for the checks because who knows how much longer it would have been.

Food - Fantastic. The calzone was amazing. And more than I could finish.
Price - Very reasonable. With tip it was $12 for a calzone and a beer.
Service - Bad. It seemed as though either the waiter hadn't waited tables before, or just really hated us for showing up.

Both times I was so impressed with how good all the food was! They cook up some really unique flavors here with very quality ingredients. Servers are also very friendly, and they really go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. 

My thoughts on the food:

Truffled Potato Chips w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce: Ordered this appetizer since its the top highlight on Yelp, and was blown away by how delicious this was. The potato chips were thick cut, fresh, and pipping hot -- it paired perfectly with the creamy, tangy blue cheese sauce. I don't even like blue cheese but I'm in love with this dish! (5/5)  

Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers: Very tender cuts of steak, thoroughly seasoned and covered w/ their house steak sauce. The dish comes with 5 decently sized skewers, but is a bit on the expensive side at $18. (4/5) 

Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings: This dish definitely satisfied my chicken wing cravings! If you've ever tried Vietnamese chicken wings, these have a very familiar taste with the strong hints of garlic and chili. Each wing/leg was generously glazed and very flavorful! (5/5) 

Prosciutto Pizza: Also ordered this dish as it was one of the top highlights on Yelp! My friends really enjoyed this pizza, but I thought the goat cheese was a bit too strong (albeit, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese). Regardless, I still really liked this pizza because the prosciutto gave it a really rich, buttery flavor. (4/5)  

Italian Sausage Pizza: LOVED this pizza! The contrast in flavors from the creamy ricotta, the sweet roasted peppers, and the juicy Italian sausage was perfection!! I might be a bit biased though because I pretty much devour anything with ricotta lol, but also the crust on both pizzas were cooked perfectly -- very thin and crispy.  (5/5)   

Also wanted to mention that the complimentary french bread we got at dinner was amazingly good since it was freshly baked, hot out of the oven stuff! They also threw in some garlic/onion & rosemary infused bread sticks that were super buttery and moist. The french bread at 4 am was just so-so, but that's to be expected haha",3,qpJvFXThQKW3bxicP9KSXw

I wasn't feeling picky and everyone seemed game after a few hotel lobby drinks, so a huge group of us drove out to check this place out.

The Horny Toad has plenty of kitsch value upon arrival, and that aspect is played up heavily. There are wacky signs, funny T-shirts, and gift shops filled with an odd assortment of local art and weird novelty items. The wait was almost 2 hours, so that left us lots of time to look around, but they did have a large side bar where we hung out and listened to some passable country covers from a local band.

Once we ate, it lost a bit of its luster. From most of the people sitting around me, word has it that the ribs were stringy and not very good, and disappointment hit a lot of my co-workers. I, however, lucked out, because I was struck by the menu's insistence on the fried chicken. The chicken was outstanding, the breading was top notch and the meat was tender and delicious. The actual barbecue sauce was excellent, and I poured that on my fried chicken (I highly recommend this if you come here!)

In the end, I didn't think the wait and the hype were nearly worth it, but I had a very yummy meal at the end of it all and I might have been the only one at our table who enjoyed our late night dinner. It's a big, weird tourist trap, but if you're coming here, take my advice and get the fried chicken.",1,P9QkVVvnBbvlg7DoGtZ0Cg

A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...

Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.

THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!

Once upon a giftcard...

So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!! 
Great job Vivace, we shall return,

This was my first trip to Madison for work (Go Badgers) and I was told by my boss I could not pass up Mickies Dairy Bar. Lucky for me, I have the sleep cycle of a retired grandmother so I was up and ready to eat by 6:00am. I strolled across campus from my hotel and found a quaint restaurant where I wasn't the only person outside taking pictures of the facade of the building. Inside, I had a flashback to the 50s that I never lived in with the old menu price and decor. I sat at the bar and took far too long to order because I wanted to examine my options (aka check out other peoples food). I settled on one griddle cake and a side of bacon as I had a long day of walking ahead. The griddle cake was the size of a toddler bicycle wheel and came along with an apology for taking so long -- which it didn't take long at all. Soon after I arrived, ESPN followed me in to shoot a special on the ""tastes of the town"". I slowed the pace of my eating to be an innocent-background-fat-kid-eating-pancakes bystander (why didn't I order an omelet...) and made friends with the locals just chit chatting. Just the one griddle cake was too much to handle but I wish I could have eaten the strawberry rhubarb cobbler fresh out of the oven steaming with melted butter right in front of my nose. The manager was so nice to explain all of the foreign Wisconsin words and foods and told me about how nuts it got during the day. I could have sat and made friends all day but I decided to scoot and pay my bill (cash only) and wander on my way. A MUST eat if you are in Madison, just arrive early!

The owner, Mike, was a surprise.  He was so laid back and relaxed to speak and deal with, as if nothing could make this man rush, but the moment he starts working with his team, he's on fire.  

I had him out here two years ago to give me a quote on things I want to do to the yard and it's a huge overhaul: remove stone, put in islands of grass here and there, plant hedges, install irrigation.  He walked me through all the details, showed me several variations of things to help me get a feel for what I'd like to do, and then we discussed price points and he got a quote to me, itemized, in 24 hours.  

I haven't taken him up on any of the services for that yet, but what I HAVE had to do is call him the night before on an emergency tree care.  Without a long story, I needed this massive, very dense, very full tree on my property trimmed pronto.  As in, before 8am the next day, or else it would be not a good morning.  He stopped by the next morning at 6AM and trimmed what would have been two hours worth of work of trimming and hauling away in no time whatsoever with a very reasonable cost.  I woke up to a perfectly shaped tree, neatly trimmed.  And I was able to pay him via his website!

5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,3,2011-11-18 06:16:06,3,YXtXTR1IfTgjKPIq0fcSaw,"Back in 2009 when Don and I were just dating, I kept telling him about a ""Cosplay Lounge"" that was opening up in Vegas. I never got around to going and soon forgot about it because it didn't gain much popularity (nothing even pops up when typed into Yelp). Forward almost three years later and Don was taking me on a ""surprise"" lunch date. He parked at Monte Carlo and I had no idea where we were going. I never even knew where the Cosplay Lounge was located, so that's totally not what I was expecting. We turned the corner and he said, ""This is it!"" and I was still confused, because it said ""Dragon Noodle Co."" which didn't ring a bell at all. That's when said, ""It's the Cosplay Lounge!""

We walked past the completely empty lounge area and into the restaurant where there were only two other people dining. The waiter brought out our menus and told us there were currently lunch specials and dim sum. I noticed Don looking around all disappointed and he told he he was confused because he expected to at least see someone dressed in costume, but not a single person was. When the waiter came back, Don asked him about the ""Cosplay Lounge"" and the waiter gave him this extremely puzzled look like he had no idea what he was talking about. So Don started describing it and talking about the costumes and the guy said, ""Ooooh, that's not all the time. It's just at night on weekends."" By the way he answered, it sounded like he was even unsure of that. I have a feeling they don't even do the ""Cosplay"" thing anymore, but I could be wrong. 

After getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. 

Overall, the two things I liked about this place were the ambiance and the Calamari. The service wasn't that great. The waiter only refilled our water once and that was when we asked him to do so when he brought out the bill. The only thing that would bring me back would be the Calamari and I'd probably order it to-go.",3,AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg

I'm writing this as I sit, extremely grossed out in my hotel room here at the travelodge. 

We checked in on Monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid. Sure it isn't the cleanest but for $30 something dollars a night you can't be too picky. We unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay, when we realized there was no key to our in room safe. We called the front desk and they offered to move us right then. We moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again. The next day, we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later, a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed. We went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didn't even bat an eye.... That was extremely disturbing to me, that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel!!! They offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and we're already running late. So we moved to our third room later that evening. Packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs.. We got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room, up until just now! I went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush!!!!!! I would be leaving but it's an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey! Each time I try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue, she 'isn't in'. Very disappointed in spending my vacation here, it has been a headache and a disaster.

We were seated, went over the menu and I had a couple questions for our waitress. I asked if they could make a tuna sandwich instead of turkey. No, as we don't have tuna in the kitchen. Okay, that's fine. 

I kept on looking and saw a nacho appetizer. Awesome, I love nachos with some added chicken for protein. Joked with my fianc√© saying she would say no again. I went ahead and asked, again, as I predicted, she said no. Not because there was no chicken in their kitchen, it was simply because they couldn't; didn't want to. 

I was already in a very shitty mood and had a blt sandwich. It was mediocre.

The owner continued to cash us out and when she was finished she said ""Ok go home now. Bye bye"". 
We were so taken back by that! Who are you to talk anyone like that, let alone paying customers!

She(the owner) told me to come in the next day. I was unable to make it on Sunday so I called and rescheduled, again she told me to come in and she would handle it. I told her I would have to come in on my lunch break so I had limited time and she understood.

From her vantage point she could see some people coming in for take out. The lunch prices are very reasonable. With your choice of entree you get a choice of soup or eggroll, white, fried, or brown rice as your side. With your check you get a store bought fortune cookie.

She had the General Tso's chicken with rice and eggroll. I had the chicken and shrimp entree mixed with vegetables. Needless to say service was fast and the food very tasty. My friend told me that her General Tso's was not overly spicy. I enjoyed my dish as well. I was please with the portion size as I normally do not finish the rice when I order. Here it was just enough.

The eggrolls came with both the duck and hot sauce almost combined but you could tell the difference just by looking at it.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs and did ask if we wanted to split the check. I refused but was grateful she had asked.

First,  the service is great! They are constantly busy but yet still make you feel welcomed.  Waiters and hostess are attentive and very warm.

As a person who has volunteered to work with children with disabilities, this was wonderful to see. Thank you staff for your good hearts. 

Now for the food...eat here...seriously. The lovely combination of flavors in their koobideh is perfect. Love the rice and it's always cooked just perfect.  Nooo hard bits..but uniformed tenderness. You don't need to add the sumac powder, but why skip it? The pita comes out hot, fresh and airy..huge by the way.  You could swaddle a puppy in that thing... The eggplant dip is awesome,  must try.

They were well staffed, and not too busy maybe 4 other tables in there with us. The restaurant itself is huge! Counting the large outside seating area.
   
      SEATING/AMBIANCE:We were seated right away and noticed immediately the ambiance was incredible! We started by trying a couple of their Mule Cocktails as there was a beverage cart making them table side which was neat. The Mule's were average, nothing spectacular. Then after a time our server greeted us after having had our drink order taken and our cocktails made at the beverage cart and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken entree and the Beef Short Rib Ravioli along with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and a side of Vegetables.  
         THE FOOD was served promptly which is always nice! The presentation of each and every course was immaculate (which it should be for the prices and being a fine dining establishment). The food itself however was underwhelming and we were rather disappointed in the quality of flavor or lack thereof. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was really just Okay along with the almost flavorless Mashed potatoes. The vegetables didn't have much flavor and were somewhat watery. The Buttermilk Chicken was average for fried chicken, probably the best thing was the Beef Short Rib Ravioli which even then I would say was just ""Good"" the best thing about it was it's unique sauce with nice flavor. The portions of course were very small (even for fine dining) and expensive. Need to deliver more then beautiful presentation and ambiance, especially in Vegas were fine restaurants are a dime a dozen.
        THE SERVICE: We maybe saw our server twice and only for a moment each time once to take order and again to deliver bill all other contact was with the the Food Delivery person or Beverage cart attendant.

Good food, but tons of problems!

1st, waitress almost skipped me for drink orders (she would've if I hadn't waved her down as she was leaving!)

2nd, I had to ask for a drink 2 separate times & still didn't get it until friend was like ""he's still waiting for his drink!"", so 3 times total!

3rd, friend ordered shrimp alfredo & it had ZERO shrimp ($2 increase!), so it was sent back only to be returned with a bunch of shrimp tails! It's in a wrap style, so shrimp tails should've totally been removed!

4th, the check was very clearly split up, but still charged wrong!

Not somewhere I'd recommend for groups. It might be ok for 1-3 people, but not sure...

I'm not a person to typically be harsh, but this was kinda ridiculous! I'd've given it a 1 star rating, but my food actually tasted good... But very overpriced!

I checked Twitter at 11:40, saw the news, told my husband (lots of exclamation marks involved), and 20 minutes later, we were there and seated.

PORK BUNS. As incredible as they are in New York. Consistency is key.
RAMEN. Good, but not great. The broth was a little too dense for my liking. I seem to recall the broth in my Momofuku Ramen at the original Noodle Bar being a bit thinner. Noodles were chewy. Egg was runny. Pork belly was pork belly.
CHICKEN AND EGG. Husband enjoyed this. Chicken was tender and not remotely lean (remember, you're at Momofuku Noodle bar). I took a bite with all of the ingredients mixed together and thought the cucumber slices set off the flavours really well.
ROASTED RICE CAKES. Nowhere near as tasty as the rice cakes at Ssam bar, with the spicy sausage and all, but still a good snack. Great texture. Bouncy, chewy, firm. They're good.

SERVICE. Excellent, friendly and efficient.
AMBIANCE. Bright, modern, and industrial but comfortable. Surprisingly spacious, especially compared to the cramped digs in New York. Since it was weekday lunch, there was a mixed crowd. Suited-up corporate drones dined happily alongside thick-rim glasses, grandpa sweater wearers.

The only things sorely missing from the experience were the Milk Bar desserts. Maybe someday, the waitress said.

They opted out of Medicare 3 years ago, so purchasing the priciest supplemental policy you could find will not help you.  Did we sign a consent form agreeing to this? Probably.

First of all, the reception staff is extremely nice and helpful, but the doctor is so rude and lacks people skills. 

Every year I refuse to order contacts through them because they're at a high markup (typically 80-100%) from what you pay online. They claim to offer price matching but then don't when they see how low the prices are. They always try to pick a fight about it instead of acknowledging that the prices are lower and it's now a competitive market place since contracts can be sold online. 

This past visit, during my annual exam, the doctor didn't do anything differently and charged my medical insurance because she prescribed me eye drops that I didn't even know I was getting prescribed until she asked where I wanted my prescription sent. I then got my EOB from my health insurance and called the office immediately and they said that I would not be getting a bill. Magically, a billed showed up yesterday and they basically told me that it was unfortunate that the doctor never told me she was doing a medical exam and that my medical insurance would be charged, but that I would still have to pay.

Pros:
Location 
Price
Cleanliness 
Hospitality 
Room amenities 
Shower! 
Good for families 
Print boarding passes 
WiFi works!! 

Cons:
Motel style, not fancy
Other clientele can be iffy
TV channels are weird 
Plane take off path, but not that bad

My toddler daughter and I stayed for 3 nights. Check in was very pleasant, easy, and informative. They let us check in a little early because the room was ready. The other associate at the desk remembered my name and reassured me that my special request of a downstairs room had been filled. We got a map with our keys, and a reminder about when and where breakfast would be. 

Parking was easy for us. Not every room has a spot in front of it, but there is plenty of parking in my opinion. 

I stayed in room 409. The room was as clean as room of this motel style can be in a location like this. If you've stayed near the Strip in a chain motel then you'll understand what I mean. It was very clean considering how inconsiderate other guests can be. Nothing gross or unidentifiable, no weird stains, no weird smells. Not a hint of cigarette smoke. 

The bath was very clean. The shower has a curved bar and magnets in the bottom so it actually keeps water in. THE SHOWER ACTUALLY HAD PRESSURE AND HOT WATER AND DIDN'T JUST SHOOT OUT MIST. It was glorious. I actually got to rinse the conditioner out of my hair! All the fixtures worked, nothing was broken. There is a vanity area with a separate seat, lots of closet space, and good lighting. 

The kitchenette was not needed, but it had a 2 burner electric stove, a sink, and a ton of cabinet space. The microwave worked very well and was clean, and the mini fridge was as good as you find at most motels. It was clean with no weird smells. 

The AC was great. There's a guard on it to keep your curtains from flying up so people can't see in. It worked very well and wasn't too loud at all.

There's plenty of lighting and electrical outlets for charging phones etc. 

The beds are ok, but some people may not like them. I didn't hate them, but they are a little.... Spring-filled, haha. They never squeaked but they felt like they should. Regardless, we slept just fine on them and didn't have any problems. Bedding was clean, no sign of bugs anywhere (I always check), and the pillows were very nice. 

The TV is a little annoying because it has a lot of empty HD channels that just take up space and make it take forever to channel surf. I only mention this because kids can be super impatient... And some adults to, tbh. Otherwise lots of good channels and a decent sized TV. 

It was really quiet concerning other guests, except one family upstairs was having a door slamming competition, I think. But I couldn't hear anything from the other rooms like TV or talking, so that's all I care about. 

I know some people complained about the airplanes taking off, but that's really hit or miss depending on your room location and the time of day or night. I have lived by lots of airports and train tracks so they don't bother me. My 2 and a half year old slept through all the planes. Every one of them. So it really depends on your tolerance for noises. It can be loud, so use your bet judgement. 

There were some ""not sketchy but still smelled like weed"" types in the parking lot just going about their business, but that's sort of expected in Vegas and in this area, so that's not the motel's fault. And you gotta remember that this is Paradise, so you might have folks coming in from the street soliciting. Just say ""Sorry, man,"" and keep walking, and you should be fine. 

10/10 for me. Very good stay, and I would definitely stay again.",3,1Z7-2FZcW6wgxqxixtFLMQ

They said that a diagnosis couldn't be made until I paid a cleaning fee that wasn't covered. Paid that and they got the AC unit working again. After two weeks they were back out as I had said it wasn't cooling like it should -6 hours to go down 2 degrees in the evening. When they came out they said everything was fine and that it was taking time to cool because it was so hot out. This was the Thursday. On the Sunday morning I woke up early to a hot house. The unit had completely stopped overnight again and this time there was a burning smell. When I called for an appointment I was told it would be Tuesday at the earliest but they couldn't give me a time or a confirmation. By Monday morning I couldn't take it anymore: the house was hot and I have an infant at home. I called the warranty company and they agreed to give me a credit to get a company of my choice out. Paid a company that could come out that day and when I explained what had been happening he went straight into the attic. No need to check the outside unit. On inspection I was informed that had Sun State gone into the attic on Thursday the problem would have been seen and corrected before it went out totally again. The motor and capacitor was gone and giving the smoke smell. Within 2 hours of it being fixed the unit had cooled the house by 11 degrees in the middle of the afternoon (big difference from the 2 degrees in 6 hours that I was told was due to the heat outside.) Although they were all very polite and quick to call me back, I had no AC for 36 hours due to the technicians not checking what they should. I was now out $150 for a cleaning that didn't need to be done, and $840 bill from the company that did fix the issue, only a portion of which was covered by my warranty.

We've had outages now for days, I've been told that my 2 month old modem/router combo FROM THEM was not covered by their warranty, so I immediately went out and replaced it- I have a work project with a deadline and cannot send anything from home. And of course, its Spring Break so the kiddo's out of school- an Internet cafe is no place I can entertain my 6-year-old. As a working parent, from home, I absolutely cannot continue having terrible service. Also, I should not HAVE to consider going outside of my house to get an internet connection when I AM PAYING FOR AN INTERNET CONNECTION. What a
concept?!

They've assured me I have great internet-speed, 10 Terabytes/second I believe they told me. I beg to differ, with new equipment- I have been waiting 5 hours to send a file that's 900 MB, AND it continues getting cancelled during these outages which starts it all over. Basically, could upload 1 file in almost 2 days. This is actually one of the more frustrating technology weeks I've experienced, and I've waisted almost 5 hours on the phone with the company trying to diagnose problems and etc... in the last 3 days.

When your internet service begins affecting your ability to work and earn a living, enough is enough... and this is the 3rd experience in the last year and a half like this- including one where they accidentally unplugged our internet at the main box and I practically had to beg them to send someone out to look at it- no one could figure out what was wrong until the gentleman realized our internet had been accidentally unplugged- this outage took days to fix/get them to finally send someone out and also affected my work.... so I have tried to be patient long enough and enough is enough.",4,uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg

We had kept the birthday boy with us while eating dinner while the rest of the party got essentially the largest room this place has to offer (Room M - located in the far back of the venue, the last room to the left). Since we were rushing in for a surprise, we didn't look at the beginning at the venue and went to the room. 

Located next to Marugame Monzo, it is along with other places in one of the hardest strip malls to park at. Most of us has had multiple experiences in the difficulty of parking in this strip mall. Theres so much this strip mall offers, and not enough parking. There's tons more parking located 2 building back but theres no easy way to access it. 

Room M is the largest room they have to offer (I believe). It has 3 long tables lining the sides of the room with a large TV in the front and smaller TV to the rear. This room can easily fit 20 people with probably room to spare. Theres enough room that even with the seats filled, the center of the room Is still empty for uh ... ""entertainment"" XD This room prices at I believe $60/hour, which isn't bad if you have enough people to split but the drinks stack up. Between a few of us, we had gotten a bucket of Cass (6 bottles) and a large bottle of Lychee Soju. Seats were fairly clean but the tables would do a better cleaning. We were given complimentary French fries to each table in the room. What was surprising was the microphones are both wireless. Never had seen that in karaoke places here. And each microphone has a replaceable cover over it too. 

We had paid separately. Due to possibly the size of the room or maybe the number of people, they had placed an automatic 18% gratuity, plus the bucket and soju totaling into mid 30s, which resulted in the bill getting to mid 40s after the gratuity.

THE FOOD:  Skin-on mashed potatoes, pork chops, stuffed cabbage, (all good) garlicy and and inconsitantly cooked green beans.  The stand out was the table full of old-fashioned ethnic cookies-- nut rolls and the like.  It really brought me back.   

THE SERVICE:  Cute old Slovenian ladies and a gentleman.  All polite and sweet, just as you'd expect.

Although Toby Kieth's I love this Bar and Grill is a little mainstream, I would consider it my favorite.  I had a lot of expectations because of Toby's, none of which were met.

I should have turned around and left when I got to the bar, ordered a Bud Light and a shot of Jack, and she laughed and said ""we don't like Bud Light here"".  I told her I didn't care what she liked, and she said ""we don't have any Budweiser here"".  HUGGGHHHHHHH?!?!

I get beer contracts and distributorships, but not having Budweiser at a country bar??

I grabbed my Coors Light, against my wishes, and took a walk.  I didn't find much that even came close to impressing me.  

I found a tiny, and I MEAN TINY dance floor in the back which doubles as a main walkway to get in and out of the bathrooms.  

The main bar in the middle is packed and lacks proper staffing.  It's almost too big.

The crowd is the standard, typical Scottsdale crowd that don't know squat about country, that probably wondered over from one of the other trendy hotspots.  There were more affliction t-shirts and high heels than button ups and cowboy boots.  Even the bartenders could use a lesson in western/country attire.  I couldn't tell who was out of place, the bar or the people.

There was a DJ mixing today's country hits.  Yes, I said mixing.  It's Scottsdale, what do you expect?

We were there for a birthday and had a reserved table, which do have taps in which you can pour your own beer....pretty cool.  However a majority of the space on the sides of the bar was taken up by these VIP tables.  Not ideal, by any means.

Overall I would never go back to this place.  I love Dierks and would have hoped he would have cared more about what he puts his name on, but the bar was packed and he obviously reaps the benefits of a full house.  Although the bar itself looked somewhat cool (if it were empty), it missed the whole country theme that Toby's has nailed.

That said, when they came out of the oven I was impressed. The crust was nice and thin and the toppings were fresh and tasty. For a grocery store pie it wasn't half bad at all. Give it a try.

Obligatory Title Pun: When in the 'burbs, I need to SLICE myself.

Menu Readability: N/A.

Need to mention: It's better than the Dominos down the street.

He (I can't remember his name- over a year ago) was so professional and advised me to get the font a certain way so the characters won't leak onto each other in the future. 
He was also super patient in the beginning with my mini freak out and my friends being there with me, which I really appreciated! He made me feel very comfortable which is so important.

It's more for the young hip peeps or couples.
I've stayed here a few times in their 1 bedroom suite (kitchen, japanese soaking tub, and a huge patio with great views.)
The room is separated by a sliding door and connected to the bathroom with a direct view and access of a Japanese soaking tub.

The main room doors connected to the hallways are SO annoying.
So heavy and loud when it shuts!
Forget sleeping on the sofa sleeper or anywhere in the living area.
Sleeper quality was really lumpy and it caved in the center.
Only place you can sleep is inside the actual room since it's furthest from the main doors and the sliding door to help block out the noise.
I can't imagine how you can sleep in a normal suite.

Other than that, the bedding is nice, and the Japanese soaking tub with a view is great.
It's a very modern look with bright blues, purples and white.

They have great restaurants at Cosmo but you must try the Secret Pizza joint.
It's between a couple of restaurants and a narrow hallway that leads to you there.

In the early days, they used to make you use your card key to access your elevator to get to your rooms. It was annoying and now they don't do it anymore, but I can see why they did.

My March 2015 visit, we had an ""un-welcomed"" visitor on our floor.
Somehow a homeless person got in and was sitting in the hallway of our floor.
There was security asking him to leave politely. I was glad there was no struggle.
I felt really bad for the homeless guy.
He was REALLY homeless and looked like he was barely able to speak or even move.
Either way...this happened and yes I freaked a little but the smell was the hard part.
The smell came into our room and the hallways wreaked.
I had to call the front to see if they can do something about the smell.
Came out a couple hours later to see that it smelled beautifully...I wondered how they did it.",7,Uit6vvFxthHbwOHIYI0sfQ

Usually, I end up eating on the patio. Tonight's dining was indoors. The decor had some beautiful features, silver tiled ceiling, frosted glass features, etched glass doors, and modern lighting. It is very well put together. 

A second feature I immediately noticed was the comfort of the dining chairs. I usually cannot find a comfortable seat in a restaurant, these are unusual in that they feel like they have lumber support! This is precious.  The lighting on the other hand could be better. I loathe when I can't see what I am eating. 

Our service was very good. Our server was very into his job. He was very detailed and explained almost every dish. It was refreshing to se someone who is excited about their job. 

The food is tasty, but it is difficult to find a healthy dish here. They serve up American fare, like pizzas, lobster macaroni, and brisket. On request you could order off their vegan menu. I thought that was a nice idea on their part.

DfgZlNgKwBvCpA_0alumXw,1,2011-06-28,0,m4qUrZcQ8pkGb5HQcJWwTg,"My first trip to the Mirage was a great one! The hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate (which is saying something for Vegas which has famously confusing casino floors). We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - Luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade. Our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job. 

There is a lot to do on site at the Mirage. The Mirage volcano (which underwent a $25 million upgrade I believe) was brand new to us on this trip - the past times we had been it was under construction. Definitely do not miss this! The pool at the Mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools I have been to. The Paradise Cafe (located by the pool) had great service and food. 

It's not advertised but the Sigfried and Roy Tiger Habitat offers a $3 per ticket discount to Mirage hotel guests if you show your room key. We gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals. 

The Beatles Revolution lounge (located just off the casino) has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere, but $9 for a Heineken bottle is a bit excessive. We loved the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil gift shop - sadly we could not get tickets for the show, so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs instead.

One downside to staying at the Mirage is the $20/day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well. To their credit, they are up front about the resort fee - it was NOT hidden, we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room.",2,_ggGvkTtaJc-w591Lc115g

I went in there and ordered the food and asked for take out after I finished 20% of the food because I want to go home and watch TV and finish the rest of the food.

I tried their sister burger place (LBS in the Red Rock Casino) and that was a pretty solid burger.  I came here with only the intention of critiquing their burger.  I was thinking of getting the billionaire burger since foie gras is now illegal in Cali, but couldn't bring myself to fork out $30 for a burger.

I was going to go with the nom nom burger, but my waiter sold me on the Gold Standard which he said was voted the best burger in Las Vegas.  How could I not try it now?  It came out pretty fast.  It did not look messy and presentation was done well.

The burger itself was above average and I give it a solid 4 stars.  However, I disagree that it is the best burger in Las Vegas and definitely disagree with the $17 price tag.  So if you're curious, to try, you will be getting a good tasting high quality burger, but you're going to pay for it.  I liked it, but I think it's a one and done for me.


WHAT I ORDERED:
Main ---
The Gold Standard: 4/5

Sides ---
Shoestring Fries: 3/5 a tad too salty

STAFF:

WAIT TIME:

Unfortunately, I will not return because I had a very uncomfortable experience last weekend with a nail technician blaming me for a schedule mixup and raising her voice at me in front of other customers as she is doing my manicure. For 9 months I had always, always scheduled with the same two technicians.. one does my mani and the other my pedi simultaneously. I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn't notify her that someone else is doing my manicure. This caught me off guard and told her I thought it's what the front desk arranged. She raised her voice said no and that it was my job to tell her this info. I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said ""next time, you have to tell me"" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me. I finally snapped back raising my voice and told her to stop raising her voice at me because i don't work there and it isn't my responsibility to arrange it and she can discuss it with the front desk. I felt SO uncomfortable. I only go to her because her work is so clean regardless of the fact that in the last 9 months she can't even manage to look me in the face and say hi. She decided to be nice after and call me ""sweetie"" and ""love"" when time came to pay. I won't put up with that fakeness and rude attitude. I'd rather she not talk to me at all and just fix my nails rather than talk to me as if I owe her something. Owners weren't there so I'm leaving this review because this info probably never got to them even after I called and complained. Oh and the techs were arguing over who was going to do my pedi. She was forced to do it and wasn't happy about it. Please get your nail techs in check and fix their attitudes.

The line is usually insanely long if you come around noon but it moves really really fast. I usually order the Hawaiian BBQ and Cannonballs, both are delicious. Cannonballs is the kind of sandwich you can just bring around with you and it'll still be delicious cold! Also, I have a weakness for their original chips. OMG! How I've missed it!

Earl of Sandwich is a great place to grab a bite and it's significantly cheaper than most places on the strip not to mention probably better for your health-wise. The only down fall is that the location is sort of small, but they offer more tables over towards the mall side.

Service:  Waitresses were sweet and friendly but food came out slow. The last sushi plate we ordered didn't even come with ginger or wasabi.

Food:  Ordered the all you can eat from the larger menu.  Initially we had decided on ordering from the 70 item menu but the sushi selection is SERIOUSLY lacking.  They offer only a few vegetarian type maki rolls and the typical kitchen stuff.

Okay, so the rice was extremely bland.  The meats/ combination was mediocre.  All in all, sushi was a little below average.  We never got everything we ordered either ... had to order the spider roll THREE times before we finally got it ... I think the chef selectively leaves off the more expensive rolls hoping that the diner will forget.  We overheard other guests complaining about the same thing.  

Ordered the agadashi tofu and it was not bad except there was a bleach taste - ugh :(  Ordered some other tofu appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting - it was cold and had these bark like paper things on it.  I have tried a similar type of tofu dish at other restaurants and it was much better.

My husband and I have hit up nearly every gun shop Vegas has to offer. When we drove by Guns & Ammo we immediately pulled in to take a look around. At that time they had just opened and were in the process of building their range. We were immediately impressed with their selection of weapons, their pricing, and most of all their customer service. Since that time, they have completed their range and it is a nice one! Definitely worth checking out. 

A few months ago we purchased a firearm for them and the level of service we received was amazing. There were some initial questions about the paperwork but the manager assured us he would resolve them. Sure enough, the next day he called us with a solution and we were the proud owners of a new firearm. After a negative experience with another range in town, we made it a point to stop by. The clerks there greeted us and even remembered us from our last purchase and visit. 

I can without a doubt say that all our future firearm purchases will be from Guns & Ammo garage. I highly recommend any gun enthusiast to check them out!",7,g41llyGP9QhTBZop7KnFpA

A group of friends and I showed up for brunch on a Sunday, and of course the first thing to note was that it was packed. We were informed that the wait would be ""at least 20 minutes"" and we all debated whether or not to wait it out. In the end we did, but I can't really say it was worth it.

The food isn't amazing-- just the usual brunch offerings. For the price, you can definitely find better or at least similar quality food for less. But that's the occupational hazard of dining in Yorkville, I suppose.

I guess what earns Flo's some redemption points is the patio. On the second floor terrace of the building, you get a nice view of Yorkville. There are huge parasols if the weather is cooperating (sunny!) and it has a very ""ladies at lunch"" feel to sit out there enjoying the sun, your eggs benny, and watching the Yorkville regulars shop themselves silly.

Also major props to our waiter. The problem with patios or sitting outside in general is that you usually get forgotten, or the waiter doesn't come by as often. Not so here, where our waiter was so efficient, I think he was a robot. We were in a group of around seven and he took our orders in two minutes flat-- same story for coffee refills, and cashing all our separate bills out. Much appreciated, would definitely come back just to see him work his magic again.

Oh, and of course, as some other reviewers have mentioned: take the elevator to the second floor after entering the building to get to Flo's with maximum ease. Try not to get distracted by the premium custom-build racing cycling store on the first floor (like I did...)!",2,4d681x3sCw1Q9ySTyTYXlw

My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert. 

About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry.

Downtown Cleveland is a ghost town and this really hurts the hotels in the neighborhood.  If you like theater, this hotel is located adjacent to Playhouse Square so it's very convenient in that aspect.

The super cheapo rate I received when I booked this hotel.  There's nothing like a HUGE bargain when traveling.

The chef's signature pasta.  Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo.  Delicious.  The dinner rolls were hot and fresh and the Mixed Greens salad was to die for.

The comfy king bed was great.  The rooms could use some updating as far as electronics are concerned though.

Some things I disliked...

My breakfast was late.

I was told to set my room-service tray outside my door when I was finished eating.  It sat there for more than 24 hours, even after housekeeping serviced all the rooms on the floor.

The added gratuity on room service is 19% which is more than  sufficient and means that I shouldn't feel guilty for not leaving an EXTRA tip.  But, for some reason, I always did.

For the second half of my stay, my whole floor smelled of sewage.  Dirty, rotten, feces.  Something was backed up somewhere and the smell was even more putrid in the bathroom.  I had to keep the door closed.  Also, There was a loud banging noise above my room.  Not man-made but something in the building itself--pipes or foundation maybe.

There is lots of parking, it's easy to find, and upon entering we were greeted by a smiling young woman who did not offer a lot of salesmanship on what was available though I had already researched the company website to find what I was looking for concerning prices and times for skating.

The main reason for going here was that I wanted a large ice rink for my son, with skate aid and a good price and that's exactly what I got.

The skate rental and ice time is $10 and the skates were in good condition. The skate aid is a $5 rental fee and worth every penny for the beginning skater.

The rink was decorated for the ""Winter Wonderland"" theme to coordinate with Christmas and the music was all holiday themed.

There were 2 young adult attendants on the ice. I did read another post here on Yelp that mentioned the place was run by teenagers and I think that's fairly accurate - though- they weren't awful. Not necessarily helpful, but not bad, they just need more training from the management in sales and customer service. I would have bought a package of lessons that day had it been offered to me because my son enjoyed it so much.

There is nothing fancy about this place but the fact that 'not many restaurants in champaign offer a similar concept, makes this place unique'. Its  a 'create your own stir fry' kinna place where you get to pick a combo of rice, noodles, veggies, meat, and numerous flavors of sauces/seasoning, which are all in turn cooked together. You also get to add naan/paratha/eggs etc. The paratha here is awesome, but also a bit too greasy (which is probably why it tastes so good). Although the downside of this concept is that, you can never get the same taste again. It lacks consistency. You might find the food delicious one day and unappetizing/insipid the other day. Whats more frustrating is that you cant even blame it on the cook :), because you picked the ingredients yourself. The chances that you might be disappointed by the food here are quite high when compared to restaurants where you know a particular item tastes good and tastes the same all the time. Cant really recommend an item here, cuz i really dunno how it might turn out for you.

All said and done, this place is definitely worth a try (atleast once).

Everything seemed nice - good looking place, good looking staff, so I had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. Our group ordered a bunch of appetizers, and I asked about the dietary content of the dishes as I and another in our party have specific issues. Our waitress went to check with the kitchen and returned to point out the dishes that were off limits and the dishes that were ""safe"". Only she hadn't checked with the kitchen and the safe dishes weren't safe. She lied to us so the two of us got sick from the food. No apologies from her, she just disappeared and another waitress took over for her. Real nice.
When I complained, management admitted that none of the staff involved had followed the protocols, and the excuse was that our server had been working there for only two months.

When I went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points. This was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire. They only had 14lbs of pressure in them, and they should have been at 30lbs. The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work. 

They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure.

Instead of Panda Express, we are blessed with Yum! Yum! China.  Their menu is nearly identical to Panda's with the predictable 2 or 3 item plate and their food offerings are all pretty similar too.  However, while they may share the same types of food, the tastes are actually vastly different.  In general, I think it is safe to say the food at YYC tastes fresher, like it was cooked more recently.  They also keep smaller portions on hand instead of the giant heaps of food you find at Panda.  Also, I have found that the weird ""off"" taste that usually accompanies Chinese food, like when you eat Beef and Broccoli and it leaves a film in your mouth, is not carried with YYC food.  If you go here, I definitely recommend the Orange Chicken.  It is so good.  They call it spicy, but it definitely isn't, instead it is more of a sweet heat thing with a lovely tangy orange sauce coating perfectly fried little rounds of chicken.  Possibly my favorite thing about this place is that actual Chinese people run it, and they are all very nice.  If I am eating ""ethnic"" food, I want that particular ethnicity to be running it.  I find it weird to be served Chinese food by Mexicans, but that's just me.  If you need a quick and tasty option at the Marketplace, you should stop by here.

The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because the food is hit or miss.

The buffalo chicken sliders are good, and so is the calamari. 

Some of the other items were disappointing. I got a meal on the menu it was ribs, fries, and one other item, I think wings. From the picture you can see the ribs and the fries are in the same container, I don't care if my food touches each other my issue was they don't toss the ribs in sauce they pour it on them when they are with the fries so your fries are covered in BBQ sauce. Not a good combo to me, I usually give my son the fries but he wouldn't eat them with so much BBQ sauce.

Also the food can be inconsistent, the first time I got the nachos they were huge, last time I went they made the plate so small, that by myself I ate over half and I'm not a big eater, the first time I didn't even make a dent in them. (They are supposed to serve 2-4 people). 

Also the first time I got the pizza bites they were awesome, another time the bread was hard. 

There is one bartender who always waits on us, I wish I had his name, he gives the best service and is really attentive even when it is busy. I always sit on the side he is serving. The drinks are always awesome even when I say ""I don't know just make me something"". 

My friend was in town for one night and I told her we should go here and we did and she was surprised at how low the bill was and said I'm glad you thought of this place. 

On a side note I left my phone on one of the games one night and was almost in tears thinking I'd never get it back.

I'm not a fan of opera or musicals, but we went to take my sister for her birthday and we all loved the show. I had seen this musical in the OC a couple of years back, but in no way did it compare to this one.
Oh and small note, you will love it and appreciate it more if you've actually seen the movie. If you have, you will love it because they did such a great job with the sets and scenes. It honestly felt like the movie was being played live right in front of me. 
The theater was so beautiful. It really looked like an opera house and it was ornately decorated. Loved the actors and actresses and the chandelier that sits above the stage is exquisite. I won't spoil any of the show but have to say that the entire opera was great. 
So if you didn't like the movie, then you probably won't like this show, but if you like musicals or plays you will definitely love it. I'm not even a fan and I loved it. If the tickets weren't so expensive I would see it each time i went to vegas.",3,Z7gX8p-qvWQLsaEHWsqQCw

We stayed during CES (The Consumer Electronics Show) so there was an est. 150,000 additional people in the Las Vegas area, and we had no idea out at Red Rock. It's 20 min. From the strip, and all freeway. It's not hard to navigate and the road system is very forgiving of navigation errors. Most shuttles don't run out that far, so renting a car was something we did right. We also thought that having our own vehicle would come in handy, and it did. We weren't tied to buses running at certain times, and we got to see a whole lot more. We even went out to Primm. Thankfully we weren't attacked by Deathclaws on the way through the quarry.

We were on the 17th floor in a suite. They are exceptional, and if you need to stay somewhere off the strip, this is the place. We did have some maintenance going on up stairs one morning very early, at 0500, but stuff happens.

It's the locals casino and it shows. It has a very good feel, aside from the ever present cigarette smoke. It lacks the rat race push of the strip. People are actually people. Lots less fake. Great service! We played on $80 for almost two hours at the blackjack table, and came away better than we started. Best casino experience we've ever had!

If you want something to eat late at night, better get it before 11 on week nights, everything shuts down.

The buffet... It was the one experience we could have done without. We had dinner there the night before we flew out. While a little bit above Golden Harvest, it made us sick. Not heaving guts, but almost hung over feeling. Buffets are something everyone says you should try. While it may be a Vegas must do, if you're primarily a clean eater, avoid it. It almost triples your food toxicity in one meal. I'm fairly sure that goes for everything of the same quality.

Yesterday I had an appointment at 10am for several repairs needed on my Impala. I didn't mind it was super busy and no one would help me at first. Once I talked with Matt about services including an oil change/tire rotation, brake inspection, wipers, detailing, recall work I expected to receive a quote over the phone around 3:30pm or sooner per Matt. Around 1pm I received a call from Nate in Sales who proceeded to tell me a bunch of garbage regarding pricing, repairs, and upgrading my vehicle which I told them numerous times I didn't want to do. He tells me the oil change is done, and he told them not to start detailing until I talked with him. Why is a sales person calling me about service repairs? He tells me I need front pads, rotors (which I knew and wanted a quote duh), says my tires have dry rot/cracking and all 4 need to be replaced. Then he can't even tell me correct pricing because he isn't in service. Nate tells me all the work will cost me $780 plus $450 mind you I have no idea for what. He tells me I need to call Matt if I want to approve the work. I call service and they keep transferring me to someone named Chris so I leave a message for him and Matt. Then I call Bill because usually I work with him. I have been getting work done at your dealership for over 3 years and supposed to be a VIP member. No one calls me back after trying to get a hold of someone in service for over an hour. Finally I talk to Chris who promises a phone call in 5 minutes from Matt. I told him to stop everything on my car because I'm coming to pick it up. I got there and sure enough my car is in the back not ready. I'm stressed out, almost in tears, and felt like going off the deep end because I was treated like crap from your employees. Matt explains to me all the work plus labor will cost me about $1300 so upgrading is the best option, I tell him again I don't want to upgrade and to bring my car out now. No one apologized, including the service manager Will who was standing right there, no one gave a rat's ass about anything except upgrading me into a newer car. I paid for my oil change and left. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. I have never been treated so poorly at your dealership in my experience over the past 3 years. Needless to say I will never be back for anything ever again.

Chocolats Genevieve Grandbois - for chocolate tasting
St-Viateur Bagel - for Montreal bagel tasting
Rialto Theatre - to tour the former movie palace
Drogheria Fine - for Gnocchi
Boucherie Lawrence - for meat-tasting
Kem Comba - for ice cream

The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area. The servers were nice, attentive, and helpful with our questions. 

We ordered up the paella feast, which includes beet gazpacho, a salad with some fancy sounding vinaigrette, and a paella plate. The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area.

The gazpacho was presented in a very fancy fashion and was served inside a neat modern cup, drizzle with some olive oil, topped with fresh-looking oval croutons. However, one bite in and the taste of salt just overpowered all the other flavors. I could still eat it but I felt as if I was eating condensed gazpacho.

Then was the salad. The salad was literally a couple large lettuce leaves with 5 olives, two slices of tomato and red onion dressed in some vinaigrette. We thought they forgot to bring out a second salad serving but the waitress had placed the bowl in the middle of our table which made me realize that it was meant to share. A bit stingy and didn't really seem like restaurant quality.

Finally, we waited on the paella. We figured the paella would be wonderful and rich and full of flavor. Instead we received plates of undercooked rice (supposedly al dente..) and extremely dry chicken. The entire place was hard to chew and tasted too salty.

On a suggestion of a friend we went to Merchant which, as described, was a  restaurant / grocery / craft bar similar (in concept) to Jeffrey's Grocery in NYC (Joseph Leonard's).

While my wife and I were unimpressed by Jeffrey's Grocery in NYC, we absolutely loved Merchant. The food, atmosphere and craft bar would put Merchant among the top ""casual"" fine dining places in NYC.... and this place is in Madison.  

Here is a New York City description of Merchant.  Put the Spotted Pig together with Le Pain Quotidien, Wichcraft and Employees Only craft bar and you would have something like Merchant.

We went for lunch and had the cured pork with fresh mozzerella and pickled onions. For dinner we had the roast chicken and trout.  The food was outrageously good.  

The only question I have is when Merchant will expand to NYC.

Hugely disappointing and I would give zero stars if possible. Waiting is always an issue when I've gone, and it's gotten to the point where it's not worth my time.

We checked in very late due to the event we were participating in didnt allow us to get to the hotel before. We walked in and found our room was 2 double beds. I called the front desk and spoke to Diana and her excuse was ""its just a request that is why we upgraded you for free"". Um no...we had already paid for this suite there was no upgrade. She sat there and argued about what we were given ""for free"". Which was nothing because we prepaid foe the room. I finally get manager who said that he'd hold the right room for us the next night but the bed selection is only a request. So though 3 months ago we requested a king bed it didn't really mean anything. Fine. Whatever. He promises someone will bring us keys, just let the desk know when we were ready. We tried to order some food but were immediately told it would be over an hour so we went to bed starving. The next morning.... Our lanai is a view of the air conditioner vents. Our shower drain doesn't really drain and the air conditioner never really stopped. We couldn't wait to get out of the room which I'm sure was an ""emergency overfill"" room.  We stop by the front desk (9am) and let them know when the room is ready so are we. ""Ok the manager will call you at ###.#### phone number when its ready"" by 3:30 still no call. So I call again to the front desk and speak to the same lady I spoke with that morning. ""Oh, they haven't called you? That room has been ready for hours! Come down with a valid ID and pick up keys."" We finally get into the room with the lanai we wanted but its now to late to enjoy. 

Everytime we came off the elevator someone from the hotel was trying to sell us something. They wouldn't take a no and would follow us a bit trying to get us to stop after we've said no.

I've had stellar service for my oil changes in the past but my experience was atrocious and absolutely unprofessional at best.

First of all, they've changed the interior service area with these high counters which is a change from their desks they used to have. The usual crew that I normally see on weekdays were not there. 

I had to ask whom I can speak with when I got in. And there was one person behind this high desk on a busy Saturday. He was unapproachable and just rude.

The worst part is when I went to pick up my car. I go in confused as to whom I need to speak with for the payment. I find some girl behind a little desk with her half eaten sandwich in full view in front of her and myself and ask if that's where I pay. 

She casually said yes and rang me up to pay. No explanation of what they had done, no going through the multiple things they did to my car, and no updates on my car's condition. 

I had to ask the girl, ""Do you know when I need to change my battery or how my car is doing?"" Apparently the 30k mike service includes my battery condition. The girl just shrugged her shoulders and said she wouldn't know. I asked that I speak to someone about my car that can answer my question. If I'm spending 8 times the amount of money than I normally do, I'd like someone to give me an update, not be rushed to make a payment and leave. 

The girl pages the supervisor who comes around and tells me, ""Some cars need a new battery within a few months and some don't it all depends.""

WOW. I'd imagine they could tell me if it was at 50% capacity or 70% if they're checking my battery levels as part of the service check. 

The supervisor walks away. After I pay she asked, ""Did you see your car it front?"" I said, ""No."" Then she tells me, ""You can walk around to the side and keep walking to look for your car. If you don't see it, then let us know."" And hands me my keys. 

MY CAR WAS IN THE WAY BACK BEHIND THE BUILDING where there are NO customers at the back of the shop. And it was parallel parked in with 6 other cars in a line. I was struggling to get my car out of this tight area all the while thinking, ""Am I an employee or a customer?"" 

A guy in uniform saw me and helped me get my car out from this tight space. Imagine the liability if I had scratched up other customer's cars on my way out? What if that was YOUR car that I bumped into? Is there any quality assurance that we are leaving our cars in good hands? How many other customers have had to pull their own car out and perhaps left a mysterious dent or a scratch on my car that I would have NEVER thought came from the dealership?l

I couldn't believe that after spending 8 times the amount of an oil change, I'd have to walk to the back and get my own car from a tight space when they have brought it out front after a simple oil change. Just imagine me clicking my keys incessantly waiting to hear my car beep back as I walked the long stretch to the side and down to the VERY END and back like an imbecile in 110F Vegas heat. 

It's unfortunate that this is the only Subaru dealership in Vegas. I no longer want to get an oil change or any service, let alone a Subaru in the future. I felt demeaned and quite frankly writing this review brings back horrible feelings and gets me very upset. I'm going to have to find an external source for my future services. 

Oh yes, I forgot to add, there's a coffee cart with no one servicing the area on a BUSY Saturday, while I saw couple employees standing BEHIND the cart, enjoying their coffee chatting away. I wasn't sure if they were the ones who were supposed to help or not. But they sure didn't even ask or take a second look.",3,B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw

So, let's set the scene.

Sunday evening, and I'm hungry.  I figure it's time for me to check out a couple more of the restaurants immediately next to my home, or at least within walking distance.  A Touch of Italy beckons, for if it's good, I'd best be frequenting it repeatedly.

The main entrance is closed, and it reads that for Sundays, please enter via the bar entrance in the back.  Looking inside, all was dark.

I'd decided to go in, so around I went.  The back was just as dark, but I opened the door, and heard the voices of the patrons.

Inside, there was one Italian-American looking gentleman behind the bar, and one seated.  Everyone else was African American.  There were maybe 25 people there.

The guy at the counter motioned over to me and told me that they only served pizza and wings on Sundays, and that they served the full menu the rest of the week.  He also mentioned that the Pizzas were really good.

I was committed, so I asked for a Pizza and a beer, and Mark motioned for me to sit next to him at the bar.  I was then introduced to every single person in the restaurant.  They all said hi, then the group consensus was that I needed a shorter name.

I told them to have at it!

While I waited for the Pizza, Mark left, telling me that he'd call the restaurant to see how I liked the Pizza.

I definitely liked the Guinness.

The decor is very much of a working class bar.  Price point is quite reasonable, without anything about about 17 dollars (for a sirloin).  After two beers and a Pizza, I was just over 20 bucks.  The Pizza itself was hand made. The crust and the cheese were all quite fresh.  I had sausage and pepperoni on the rich bed of tomato sauce and mozzarella.  It was good.

I suspect that I won't be bringing many guests here, but I think I'll go back again.  Next I'll try out the pasta selection; just not on Sunday.

It's difficult to score, because I'm not really a patron of this sort of restaurant, but I feel a little like it's like that bar in Cheers!, where everyone knows your name.  :)",8,kcLuh-ck_Zj07TsodaaNUA

The name of the restaurant Katsuya combines the words ""Katsu"" which know in English as Japanese Cutlet or Meat Chop and ""Ya"" which means House.  Though they specialize in pork cutlet, they also serve Chicken, Fish, Cheese Katsu, Burger, Udon and other delicious appetizers like Curry Karaage, Takoyaki, Takowasabi, Tartar Shrimp, Freid Oysters and Cheese Crabmeat Croquette. 

Katsuya has three locations in Toronto, North York and Mississauga.  I've never been in other places but Toronto location. I came here at least four times already. I lost counting and forgot to check in some time lol. My husband and I love their Katsu. Katsuya is a go-to place for Katsu. I would recommend it!  

FOOD (4.75/5)

 THE BEST THING HERE is UNLIMITED RICE, MISO SOUP and CABBAGE for those who order Katsu sets! Who wouldn't like to order their Katsu, right!? If you come here, you should try their Katsu. It's a Must! Their staff were super helpful and friendly. So feel free to ask them to refill your rice, soup and cabbage if you finish the old ones and are still hungry. 

Everything in the restaurant is made fresh and in-house. You can see mountains of their bread pile up at the counter. Those are for making breadcrumbs. They claim that they bake it daily! Aww, crunchy and yummy!  The presentation was lovely. It's good for Instagramming lol.  The portion of each dish also was huge. I always had leftover for my next meal.

What did I have?
Let's talk about their Katsu. Their Katsu sets come with rice, cabbage and miso soup. The price starts from $13 and varies to what kind of meat you choose for your Katsu.  

- KATSUYA ORIGINAL  . This dish is a Must-Try. Yes, it's because it says 'original Katsuya' ^_^ Every original dish is always good, don't you agree!?   The special of the dish is the Katsuya's house sauce made with over 5 seasonal fruits, 10 vegetables, and 6 organic herbs. 

- CURRY KATSU with Pork Tender. This dish is a traditional Japanese style curry made with braised onion and chicken broth. Simple but taste awesome!

- TERRI MAYO with Chicken Katsu. The Katsu topped with premium BONITO FLAKES   They kept moving when we were eating them . If you like teriyaki sauce, you should order this one. The Sauce made with fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs. 

 - CARBONARA KATSU. If you like a little bit fusion mixed the traditional Japanese Kastu with Italian style, you would like ""Carbonara Katsu."" The special carbonara sauce made to order using fresh cream, shrimp, squid, bacon, and vegetables. It was delicious and creamy! 

- CURRY KARAAGE CHICKEN. Another must-try dish    . The curry karaage chicken made with chicken preserved in various fruits and vegetables, with a thick curry flavor and fried. They have both in Appetizer and Main Dish. You can also choose to have the Curry Karaage with Chicken wings or Chicken Thigh. Both are delicious! I will order it again and again.

DRINKS (4.75/5) 
  Don't forget to check in on Yelp and get a free soft drink of your choice. You can ask your server what kind of soft drinks they have today. Usually, they have Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Ginger ALe and Nestea. If you read my review, you are yelper. So checking in is what we always do, right!? 
BEER. They have 3 kinds of Japanese beer, Sapporo, Asahi and Kirin. They're $5.95.   

SERVICE (4.75/5) 
Like I earlier, their staff are friendly and helpful. Yes!

AMBIANCE (4.75/5)

I requested soft poached, one was perfect and one was quite under, with a lot of the whites barely cooked. Hollandaise was ok, nothing exciting but not terrible. The potatoes were again just ok, but needed salt desperately.

Knowing that the battery was still under warranty at Auto Zone and replacing one little pin on the windshield wiper didn't take anywhere close to an hour to replace, I told them I didn't have time to wait. Suddenly, the repair would ""only take a few minutes "", but presumably still cost $125. I paid for the oil change and left.

Guess what happened next? After driving a mile, I discovered they disconnected the *driver's* side windshield wiper. It had been working fine when I originally drove it on the lot. It was pouring rain, so I went back and told him his guys disconnected the working wiper and didn't reconnect it. Now, it didn't work at all. ""That's strange,"" he replied. ""Yes, it is, since it had been working fine for months,"" I responded. They reconnected it, only to have it disconnect again a few miles down the road.

When I went to Auto Zone, I watched him test my battery and I saw the results. Guess what?  It was running at 96%. That's another $150 Big O tried to bamboozle me out of.

Crooks or incompetent buffoons. Either way, STAY AWAY from these losers, that is unless you want more stuff broken on your car than when you drove it on the lot.",2,krfjeLgtkkR13tqTY-qeDg

Plenty of TVs inside and plenty, PLENTY of beer both on tap and in cans/bottles. A pretty good selective menu as well. My wife loves wings, so anywhere we go she will judge a place by their wings and how they're prepared. Myself? I'm judging you by your burgers and man the rival burger was pretty good. Half pound burger with coleslaw (which I usually hate) 2 ale battered onion rings with a fried egg. Man it was amazing. I've tried my best to keep away burgers with eggs on them but man, the flavor of an egg on top is actually amazing. My only gripe with the burger is that the onion rings retained too much of the oil they were fried in. Yes, yes it's greasy bar food but man the onion rings, although very tasty, were a little too greasy. As far as their selection of beers (which seems almost endless, with a few Brews made in-house) I ordered  wild Ohio's tea beer which I freaking Loved. Man, I'll definitely be going back",2,ypKZT3cHMUKv15JfKmxnkQ

Fresh is the place I go to when...

- I need to feel ""clean"", or ""detox"" from a bad week/day/month of overindulgence 

- I have an audition/tryout to attend the next day (or a few days before) and it involves wearing a bathing suit or something really form fitting

- I feel like boycotting meat

IN Vancouver, my favourite place is The Naam (open 24/7, all veggies!) so when I arrived in TO, I set out hunting for the next cool veghead place.

And so far, Fresh fills my veggie void. It's not overly expensive (though anyone would surely feel a tad ripped off paying $9 for a bowl of steamed veggies).

You can order tons of sides at $2-4 (hello, yam fries? normal fries? steam broccoli, kale, etc.). I like this arrangement, because if I'm feeling a little naughty, a small side of fries won't kill me, but an appy-sized plate of fries probably would make my butt and thighs upset.

Anyway - I digress. When you get there and if you're bringing out-of-towners, order the Quinoa battered onion rings. It looks interesting/impressive, very unique - you only get 5 bigass rings but trust me, they are worth it and if you start off with those, you won't be able to finish your meal.

Now, for your meal, I highly recommend one of their bowls. And if you get it with rice, request ""more veggies than rice"" - they are good at fulfilling that request. Buddha and Goddess are the best ones, and same with the Macrobiotic (micro?) bowl... clean and simple!

OH - and the soup. Oh, the soup. SOmetimes I'll just go for the soup - a cup or a bowl or a bowl with salad. The soup is great, its just pureed veg at the end of the day but my fave is the Jamaican spinach and zucchini - a lil spicy but great spices. Their soups are always good and they change all the time. 

They also have a prix fixe which includes a smoothie (pure fruit and goodness), appy, entree and dessert all for $21. YOu can't lose!",11,2AtXEH0Gs3JCVEmXv2gISQ

I love the location in downtown Chandler.  The eclectic, artsy vibe down there is quite refreshing compared to the Mill Ave / Old Town Scottsdale one.

We weren't quite ready to order when our waiter came by to take our drink order, and he seemed mildly put out by that. He seemed put off the rest of the evening. The drink menu consisted of a variety of wines, beers, and some unique cocktails. The dinner menu was not large, but contained multiple intriguing items that we don't see on many menus. There were also a couple of specials in addition to the regular menu items.

For an appetizer I had the carpaccio. This was a full-size plate of thinly sliced beef with crunchy fried sun-choke chips on top. It was absolutely delicious and felt like a decent portion for the price. Others in our group had the lobster bisque which they said was the best bisque ever, a parsnip soup which also had rave reviews and a salmon tartar which I will also vouch for. Delicious food and beautifully presented.

Entrees can be ordered in either full-size or half portions which is a nice touch. I had the game hen which was served with potato gnocchi and mushrooms. It was perfectly cooked, beautiful to look at, and tasted amazing. The rest of our group had the wagyu steak, halibut, and duck breast. Again everyone in our group was thrilled with their entrees. The taste, the textures, and the presentations were all spot on.

When the check came, each of us received a small slice of coffee cake individually sealed to take with us. This was again, a very classy touch. In that same vein, I have to comment on the men's room. It's highly unusual, but several of us noticed how good the men's room smelled. I don't know if it was proximity to the kitchen or if they pipe something in there, but it smelled like dessert.

The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is our waiter. He didn't do anything wrong specifically, it was just his surly attitude. It felt like we were putting him out whenever he came to our table.

//Cheesecake Tart// (14.99)This was recommended to me by by my co-worker and cousin and I was really excited to try this famous cheesecake. Sadly, I was underwhelmed by the taste. It wasn't as cheesy as I hoped and it tasted too light. This particular cheese tart had a thin jelly upper layer that gave the cheese tart an interesting texture (not quite a fan of it). 
//Golden Brulee Cheese Pudding// (3.99) Packaged in its own to-go box with the sugar and caramel sauce. The pudding itself was airy and firm and it was yummy. The caramel sauce was too concentrated and gave a liquor-y taste. I would've prefer the pudding by itself.

This is a cool place to come to if you can't afford to go to the original in Japan. This place is beautifully decorated to suit the modernness of the store and it has a cute overhead light that resembles a gooey cheesecake. There's a variety of seating in this cozy establishment. They have a wall you can buy merchandise from. I love how you can see the freshly baked Cheesecake Tart getting the signature emblem near the entrance of the store.

I decided to wait at one of their outdoor tables. After 20 minutes, I returned inside to ask if my food was done. It was not and the front desk staff explained that it was very busy and the kitchen was backed up. When all was said and done--it took about 60 minutes for my order to be ready. 

That was a bad start. When I got home, I found the sushi to be fresh and tasty so that did redeem Ginza in my eyes. I enjoyed all three of the rolls I had ordered.

I am only 12 weeks, so I didn't think I was ready for a maternity store, but my jeans are a little snug, and I didn't want to buy a new pair of regular jeans that would only last me a couple of months tops. My husband and I wandered in and were met by Lisa. She told me that anything I buy now should take me through my pregnancy, so I started grabbing jeans. She also measured me and gave me a bunch of bras to try on.

First of all, I did not know they made designer maternity jeans. The nicest pair of jeans I have is from J Crew, so I guess it took the insecurity of pregnancy bloat to push me over the edge. I also had no idea what a nursing bra was, but they had the same brand as the bras I get at Nordstrom, the only difference is they have clips and a little sling inside the cup. Otherwise, I would have never known the difference. 

Lisa was a huge help throwing me in different sizes. It was also great being able to show her the fit of the jeans and bras to get her feedback on if I needed a different size. My husband and I walked in nervous and dreading the experience, but it turned out being a lot of fun. I ended up spending a small fortune on new jeans and bras, but it was such a relief to walk out of there knowing I am covered now that the weather is getting chilly. The jeans fit so well, and the bras are so awesome, that for the first time in 12 weeks I actually feel half way like a *woman* again rather than just some weird alien baby vessel.",3,zJM2JPFDafXxBRj90r1Klg

I earn a lot of COMPS and free hotel rooms at the Sahara. Sahara is the last of the old Dynasty chains of the Rat Pack Hotels. Sahara has the best deals in town in some retrospect.

The Caravan Cafe is a 24 hour Cafe in the Sahara Casino right across the Poker Room. I did not dine in, but I did take it to go since I was hungry at 3am and wanted to eat in my room. I thought of the Cafe as a Denny's maybe Denny's got their idea from the Caravan, but the food was superb.

I ordered a Sahara Burger ($8.95) and a Turkey Club ($8.50 or $8.95) Instead of Fries, I had Cole Slaw and Potato Salad. Don't forget that they do charge for Order Out. I think its $1.50. However, if you have a Club Sahara Card, I think they waive the charge. I think my total was $20.48, but since I used my Club Sahara Card, they waived the $1.50 and it was around $18 to $19 that they took off my comps. All I remember was the cashier saying that she would take something about $2 less than what I saw on the receipt.

The Sahara Burger was meaty and delicious especially with the Cole Slaw. My friend had the Turkey Club and it was just as good. Although I think my friend wanted the Cole Slaw, so we exchanged the Potato Salad..lol..

Peter was my waiter and he served me very well while I waited for my togo order. Since my food was free, I gave him a $5 tip for watching over me (Giving me something to drink, making sure I'm ok) He even gave me some extra stuff that would've normally been charged.

In the end, its just a diner/cafe. I just needed something to eat without traveling outside of the hotel. Nothing really special and really soothing to eat in without the crowds. It may be the oldest hotel on the strip, but it still has a lot values for visitors.

Their wine list is varied and pricing is reasonable. We ordered a bottle of the ""Frogs Leap Zinfandel and it was delightful! The menu gives you the option of ordering several small plates, which I did, or a nice sized entree. I ordered the Calamari, which was an amazing blend of Cilantro, tiny slices of carrots, and hints of a Thai peanut sauce and small pieces of chopped peanuts. The calamari was tender and cooked to perfection. My guest shared this and also really enjoyed it. As my other course, I ordered the Mussels and frites, which were cooked perfectly, tender, with a nice white wine broth and plated with the frites resting on top. Excellent!

Located next to Frys on Rural and Ray.  We frequent takeout more often then dine-in. They have reserved spaces and a special door for takeout which makes it very handy.  

If you dine in it is casual and very hip. Well decorated, trendy lights, lots of tables, booths and a bar area to the left.  

Look for coupons in the Wednesday mail.  Altbough, the prices are very reasonable.  Complimentary wRm bread and olive oil is a great start.

My dear wife likes the chalkboard menu. The chalkboard menu is an assortment of different dishes and your choice of meat.  The roasted asparagus salad with chicken is a favorite.  

The kids calzones are amazing and enormous. The choice for kids is pepperoni or cheese.  The adult calzone is enormous and wonderful as well they have a special which has pepperoni mushroom and sausage. Big enough for two meals.  

If you get takeout ask for extra marinara for the calzones. Also with takeout complimentary bread is provided which is a nice touch. They even have a small container for the olive oil balsamic dipping sauce.

I have always found service to be friendly and quick.  Last night we had Emily J as our server. She was great.  Attentive and very helpful.",0,MgtGF4xsl57t-LKhP4WTeA

Then he prescribes our cat with some antibiotics, a urine-collector bottle and some plastic beads to place on our cat's litter so we can collect urine from it.

We were going to another breakfast place in the DC Marketplace but the wait was over 30 minutes, so we decided to head over to Herb Box.  I have heard so many good things about Herb Box's brunch and I am so glad we went because it was the best brunch I have had in a long time! 

Luckily, there was no wait to be seated and we were seated inside the restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and quick to take our drink orders. I ordered a vanilla latte, Shannon ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband ordered mango lemonade. For brunch, Shannon ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes and my husband ordered an omelet. I couldn't decide between the cinnamon pancakes or the bourbon peach French toast and asked our waitress which was better. She told me that the French toast was definitely a favorite and was almost sold out for the day. I jumped on that and was so glad I did. 

Our drinks arrived shortly and I really liked my latte. It came in a tall clear glass, reminiscent of what you'd normally serve an Irish Coffee in. My latte was both sweet and bitter at the same time which was delicious. Shannon enjoyed her orange juice since it was freshly squeezed and sweet. My husband enjoyed his mango lemonade but I thought it was a little watered down.

Next, our food arrived. Upon first bite of my French toast, I was in heaven. My husband described it like eating bread pudding for breakfast and he was right. It was both heavy and light at the same time and the flavors were outstanding. I didn't even need the maple syrup they serve alongside it - the bourbon did an excellent job. It came with bacon and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Shannon enjoyed her pancakes and I tried a bite. It was truly like eating cake - super moist and chocolaty. My husband enjoyed his omelet and I agreed it was delicious. The Brussels, manchego and pancetta really blended well together.

If you look, I usually like to only review places I LIKE. So people will go there. Why waste time to help advertise places I do not like. This is an exception.

Here is the gist, my friend had left because she was hung over. She had ordered bread from the cart, prior to leaving. I did not. So she got her food in a box and left, while myself and 4 other friends stayed for the rest of the dinner. While we were enjoying our entrees I was eating HER bread. The bread was wheat bread, and I admit, was delicious. So the waiter (whom french accent sounded super unauthentic) seeing that she left, comes over to clean up and remove her place setting - which is normal. He reaches over and grabs the plate with the bread on it, which was next to me. I tell him ""No no leave the bread, I am eating it"". Now, what is the common sense  thing to do, if you were the waiter?

Think about it... Common sense?!?!

Answer: You put the plate down!!! walk away and let the customer enjoy the bread! 

Right????

You do not even need to say anything, but of course, instead of doing this, he spoke back in condescending tone ""But monsieur, that is the ladies bread"" as if I broke some sort of natural law- Is it really unacceptable for me to eat someone else bread?If the same situation occurs at any other restaurant, I can *almost* guarantee you they will put the plate down and would probably even be glad to do so. 

So he grabs the plate (with my hand on the plate as well!) and said ""I will bring you another bread"". I totally recall thinking... Why is he arguing with me? So he takes off with the plate and this was when I was not too happy. He did come back with bread, but it was NOT the same type!! Obviously, I am not going to make call him out because it is not the same kind of bread but this added to my fury!!!!

Alright, because this happen with bread, you may say ""it's only bread"" Well, lets substitute this situation with say.. soup. Your friend leaves so you are enjoying their clam chowder which was ordered. The waiter comes over to deny you of it, even though you ask to leave it there. He brings you a new bowl of soup, however when it arrives, its some cream of broccoli. 

I know most of you would say something about the soup!

Anyways the food.. I ordered the Kobe Beef. I had six ounces of it, its sold by the ounce. It was not good. The above incident occurred during the main course, so I stopped eating. Left a couple ounces on the plate and did not allow anyone to touch it. 

Another one of my friend saw I was upset and so she said something to the manager (or owner, not sure) and he provided complementary glass of wine to everyone. I made sure nobody drank the wine they gave me. 
I do not need this crap and you do not either, hundred of places in Vegas to have a great dining experience. I walked out upset. 

it maybe a funny story with my friends and I now but at the moment, I was Pissssssed.

I mean COME ON VAUGHAN!! Support your very own!

I've been following the growth of this GTA-born and bred brewery since I first came upon them when they only had demo cans for show at the King City Craft Beer and Food Truck Festival. It all began with their original Vienna lager ""Mad Quacker Amber Lager"", and shortly grew to their ""Black Hops IPA"" and now they boast 11 unique flavoured beers which and continue to grow by a new release each and every month.

Their brewery/tap room and retail are massive, the production facility which is in full view from the tap room extends the length of nearly a soccer field. The tap/room and retail is no slouch either, with seating for 50+ and a long live-edge wood bar all under massive 35-foot ceilings and floor to ceiling windows with views to the outside. Overall, they've captured that cool industrial feel and planted it in the heart of Vaughan (literally on the doorstep of Vaughan Mills Mall).

Best of all is the growler situation here, of their 11 on tap varieties you can score a growler in your choice of 7 of those varieties. Check in regularly for growler deals! Due to their convenient location just off HWY 400 N, Lake Wilcox is an ideal stop on the way up to cottage country to stock up.

The majority of the instructors I've had have done a good job at keeping up with the rhythm of talking about the postures and correcting students in quiet by moving the mic and discreetly correcting postures so the rest of the class can focus on themselves; however the instructor Toni Jo Wilgar straight up stops the class to call people out and stop talking about the postures to say "" okay now Ryan, i want you to move your elbow against your right knee and bring your left arm up to the air, yes thats good, no that's not the way you need to move your right knee back a little more...yes...yes"" (you get the drift) while the rest of us are standing in the posture for longer than we are supposed to while the other student is getting corrected, and here is Toni going ""okay where was I again? was I on the second set?"" I MEAN COME ON.  it gets very frustrating, especially when it occurs multiple times during the class.  I'm not butthurt about being corrected, I welcome criticism. however, dont stop the rest of the class for a lengthly amount of time to correct someone.  be discreet about it and keep up with the rhythm of the class.

Also, let me point out how unprofessional she was at the end of the class.  I walk out and am enjoying my zen moment after being in savasna for awhile, she immediately comes up to me and corrects me on one of the postures that I was doing wrong in the class ( mind you, I was modifying it due to medical conditions) which I explained to her however welcomed the criticism, then she continued to talk to me about the posture, sort of taunting me about taking corrections then I said "" I""m sorry I just feel like you waste too much time correcting people and calling people out multiple times (not me)  versus worrying about the rest of the class and it makes me lose focus when I'm waiting for you to continuously correct people"" ...HERE IS THE BEST PART: she goes "" Is THAT the reason you were giving me dirty looks in class??"" I look at her, say nothing, ignore the question and just walk to my locker because Im not looking for an argument.  then I hear her talking to other students who are just walking out of savasna saying "" She said she doesn't like the way I teach and she gave me dirty looks the entire class"" shout out to TONI JO WILGAR because that is VERY professional of you.  especially in your own work setting in front of your clients.   Glad other people heard our conversation also and opened their eyes about how you should probably keep your comments to yourself if you want to be professional.

To sum it up:  This studio is amazing, its disciplined practice which takes time, patience and motivation to achieve your goals. It all depends on the instructor, and what you make of the class.  I strongly recommend to avoid toni jo's class as she has completely respect of not only myself but of others who have attended her class and seen her lack of professionalism afterward.",8,UPXqS_rU4DjynQ6BTqg9xg

Cafe Bink seems to be the much more approachable little sister of Binkley's. It's situated right along Tom Darlington (Scottsdale Rd) just before you hit Cave Creek. Simple little strip mall location, with an interesting shade-sailed patio. A little close to the road noise, but great views to the West. This is a real new bistro menu, and from I've had so far, it's wonderfully executed.

SETTING
Scenic, if you ignore the stripmall to the East. Carefree/Cave Creek is a different beast than it was 10 years ago, for better and for worse.

SERVICE
Our amiable but ditsy server managed to get everything out in order, and with a smile.

FOOD
Just look for the pictures from Ron B above. That's my review. Plus the 5 stars. Only thing I will say is: best frites in town. Wish they had a straight up Aioli. And the green dipping sauce was just ""off"" somehow for my taste. Otherwise... well I gave it 5 stars.

If you get near it for some reason, check it out for lunch or dinner.",3,axGqLJ9UWb7P4sBXafOeeA

The slaw is only OK, but to me, slaw is essential for barbecue. This is why I wish the small plates came with two sides. The sweet pickled onions are a nice touch.

Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Would come back? Yes

This restaurant is owned by a Vietnamese family serving northern-style (Hanoi) pho. Its menu emphasizes the health benefits of pho and uses no MSG, organic broth. 

What I ordered:
1. Pho Vistro (Chicken & Beef Pho) (4.5/5) - a hearty, light broth full of flavour but not too salty. The noodles are thicker than the typical pho noodles you would see at most restaurants - this is unique to Hanoi pho. I would recommend getting this and if it's too mild for you, you could always add hoisin/sriracha. It's around $10 per bowl, so on the pricier end for pho, but well worth it for the higher quality ingredients. I finished the entire bowl including the broth - and it didn't leave me dehydrated and wanting to drink water for the next 5 hours!

2. Chicken Fried Spring Rolls (4/5) - the spring rolls were crispy and tasted authentic. The flavour is on the milder side - you could tell they didn't add too much salt. My only wish is that they had pork spring rolls! 

3. Vietnamese-Style Ribs (4.5/5) - extremely tender and flavourful braised beef, comes with a side of rice and salad. Loved the tangy coleslaw-style salad on the side!

4. Vietnamese-Style Chicken Wings (4/5) - came with 5 wings, these were pretty standard chicken wings. Flavour was just right. 

At the end of my meal, they gave me a loyalty card. I'd definitely come back again for the healthy pho and an even larger side of Salad Vistro!",2,C22Pl7wBn8T3UlXDbHkEig

I was in town for a conference, so this hotel was perfect for meeting up with colleagues and for the ease of going to the meetings and then back to my room to rest up. I highly recommend Westgate if you're not needing to be in the middle of the Strip (not walking distance), and if you're at the Conference Center for business. I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more ""themed"" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino. No special frills, no theme, no story, no fanciness. It is affordable and a good idea to say hotel moneys in Vegas. The staff at the front desk was super friendly (which I really appreciate). The person checking me in (at 1am) was great to talk to and even upgraded me to a large room at the 28th (out of 29) floor, just so I could have a better view. It was an appreciated gesture and one I will continue to praise. The quality of the room, however, left to be desired... It had obviously not been updated in years (shades of brown, low ceilings, broken bathroom fan, one of the two heaters was broken and only blowing cold air, rust around all bathroom fixtures and broken coffee table in the living room).

Then I was asked for my business license... okay it was never mentioned I would need it, but luckily I had brought it just in case... My business is licensed in California, where I moved from and I am in the process of moving it to Nevada, so I give them the CA business license info and I am told that the business has to be licenesed in NV... so I have proof of income from a bank in town.. why in the world would it matter where the business is based.. if I worked for a business that has its corporate office in New York and I work in NV and I get paid in NV how does it matter where the business is based?  This made no sense.. when I was pre approved on the phone it was never mentioned or asked where the business was licensed... They knew from my on line application and from my conversation on the phone that I owned my own business.. why wasn't it ever mentioned?  How was I pre-approved then told I didn't meet their requirements after I had wasted my time gathering the info they wanted and going to their location? 

I left and called their 800 number back.. explained to the customer service rep my problem and he agreed that it shouldn't matter at all where the business is licensed... he asked what location I went to and after a 10 minute hold (another total waste of my time it turns out) he connected me to someone who I believe was at the location I went to.

I personally believe businesses deserve to hear it from a Customer first and have the opportunity to right any wrongs than to read it via negative review but I realized that after speaking to their ""manager"" that this place is a joke. Stranded in a random business area, I wanted to try this place because it was listed as one of the best in Las Vegas. Best of poor sanitary conditions, lack of professionalism, and common sense? Probably. I ordered a scallop salad which had a hair on it. I brought it to the attention of the server who then flagged down another. In a short amount of time the attention of one server became a council of 5 or 6 servers debating on the hair. Really? Right next to my table? As if taking maybe five steps to the kitchen to discuss the situation wasn't common sense. I requested to speak to the manager to point out how uncomfortable it made me feel that their front of house staff would act in such a way and not in the privacy out back. The manager then came out, apologized but had the nerve to say ""just so you know the cook that makes the salad is nearly bald."" As if that matters? My hair is dyed blonde. Do you think that makes me feel comforted that this hair didn't come from a cook? I wouldn't even eat my own hair what makes you think I care? Instead of just handling the situation properly and understanding that my concern was towards the front of house staff conduct. She proceeds to say ""oh you know mistakes happen."" Got it. So not only did you not understand my concern. You choose to brush it off. I wonder how the health department feel about your ""mistakes happen."" Your ""I'm sorry"" loose apology doesn't mean anything if you can't understand that the issue lies with the front of house staff. Thanks for the lack of care.

Someone keyed my wife's Acura all down the side and I had a spot under the liftgate that began peeling. I'm certain the peeling is a factory defect but Acura wouldn't do anything about it as the car is a few years old but I digress. 

Long story short, went to almost every auto body shop in East Valley and they all told me the same thing, the paint is a three stage pearl, very hard to match, will have to paint adjacent panels to keyed areas to match it all. As for the peeling area, well the liftgate, roof rack and front windshield all have to come off. This was a surprise to me because the peeling area was easily accessible with the liftgate open. All I wanted was the peeling repaired so it didn't get worse and spread to the roof of the car. 

Let me tell how outrageous the quotes were from all these shops. Did I tell you too that I was paying out of pocket for this?

Gateway Auto Body was an entirely different experience. I wasn't met by some estimator that gave me the same old story as mentioned above. The owner of the company did the estimate. Said he
could fix the keyed panels no problem, the adjacent ones didn't need to be painted and color matching was not an issue. He also looked at the peeling section and said oh yeah, just some light sanding, painting, clear coat, will be as good as new. I told him about the other quotes, them wanting to take the car apart, he laughed and replied, ""that's because they're estimators have never painted cars and don't know what can be done.""

He was exactly right. As you can imagine, his quote was lower than them all, in some cases, less than half, no bull. Got the car back in five business days and it looks perfect, both the keyed and peeling sections.

I also got her vanilla lemonade.  I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.

I didn't like the plantains, though I'm a hard sell on that, since I don't like bananas much.  They were too hard and dry for my tastes.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I really wanted to try Houstons. The prime rib we ordered was alright, and I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was TO DIE FOR! The marinade on it was perfect but the only thing was that it somewhat charred the meat since I'm guessing there was sugar in the marainade and that burns quickly. Our dishes came with a HUGE baked potato that I couldn't even finish.

Overall, I would revisit Houstons again for their Hawaiian Rib Eye and perhaps some sushi rolls.",3,vsfG95vDU20d7upU1Zs6uA

2. It sits in the same parking lot with a Subway.. An Irish pub? Seriously? 
3. The interior is okay. They got enough TVs, I asked to turn on a channel to see the review of the English Premier League day, she didn't find any. Though she found one and I was able to see sketches of the Totenham - Chelsea game. That's a plus.
4. They don't have Pumpernickel.
5. Made my order over the phone, was trying to customize menu replacing the regular mashed potatoes from the corned beef and cabbage plate with the garlic mashed potatoes and beans. She said she don't have the beans but I saw them in another menu item! The beef and cabbage was okay. But I think they felt wrong, tasteless. I think the plate needs more spices. Not too bad considering I paid my visit at 11 p.m. on Jan the 1st.
6. With Yelp check in and my order of one main entree, I got to pick any appetizer item from the menu for FREE. I picked a bowl of Mussels worth of $10.99 (my main entree was $12.39). Wow! Yelp is a cool thing!
7. My bartender was okay, willing to chat a little bit, paying attention to my needs but nothing more than that. 

I kinda didn't like the atmosphere, just not to my taste.

I was with a group of 8, some of which were Korean food virgins.  Everyone was really happy with their meals.  I ordered the japchae (which was exciting because it isn't always served as a main dish) and while it was a little saucier than some I've had, it was still tasty as heck.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and they were all very good.  The seafood pancakes were off the hizzay.

The waiting staff were very friendly - our waitress was patient with me when I attempted to order in Korean :) We over-ordered bottles of soju, so I was pleasantly surprised they took one back.  Some places wouldn't do that, I'm sure.

The food here is alright. I had the calamari and it was cooked perfectly. Two dips came with it and it was alright. One co-worker had chicken parmesan and a side of poutine (looked like she enjoyed it because she had no complaints) and my other co-worker had a veggie burger and she was pleasantly pleased with her meal.

The hot-dog was good for sure, but it was just one single fancier than average dog - not really worth the price tag. The rest of the plate was a swarm of fries, so it got kind of boring after awhile. Also, they used a sweet pickle on my hot-dog. A SWEET pickle - my worst nightmare!!! (I'm kidding, it's not that bad, I just like sour ones better). My borfriend went for the Mac & Cheese poutine, which was much more interesting and yummy. The Oreo milkshake we shared was quite nice too. It was served in those retro snack bar metal cups, and made entirely with thick, heavy vanilla ice cream. Chef on Call used to make their milkshake like that too, but have since opted for a lighter version, with mostly liquid milk it seems :( 
They had a lot of choices on their menu (porc, beef, vegetarian; hot-dog, burger, poutine) and the service was great. There's plenty of TV screens in Dirty Dogs, so it was possible to watch the ongoing hockey game from pretty up every seat.

The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.

The broth was very rich in flavour. It wasn't too spicy. You can definitely taste that the beef bones have been brewing for hours with the lemon grass.

I'm one intense Giants fan with certain game watching behaviors - sometimes I wear eye black or paint my face, I may jump around a lot so I need a little space, I get decked out head to toe in my team's colors, I'll curse and talk to the TV under my breath, I'll cheer with excitement, I may bite you if you block my view of the TV (just kidding, or am I?) and I like to heckle anyone who isn't rooting for the same team as me. What can I say? I'm fierce and I love the game. My father raised one heck of a sports fan. I've got a lot of pride in my team, and not every sports bar can accommodate my love for the San Francisco Giants. 

Furthermore, I knew I needed some pop in my Scottsdale sports bar batting order but I wasn't quite sure where I was going to find it. I had heard about this Blue character but I didn't know if he would cut it in my MLB - Major League Bars. Well, Blue threw on his # 32 jersey and proved to be an All-Star player by coming through in this clutch situation. Blue 32 is a quality bar with an exceptional atmosphere. What a great acquisition! Blue 32 covered all the bases.

Base One - Blue possesses great range in the outfield by strategically placing a ton of TVs throughout the restaurant. TVs galore! Every spot is manned and defended by a TV so it's impossible to miss a play. These huge TVs provide great visibility from all angles. That way, there are less call discrepancies. I can see all the plays up close and personal, allowing me to critique a pitcher's pitch, a batter's swing or an ump's call.

Base Two - Blue's wait staff turned multiple 6-4-3 double plays because no one dropped or boggled the customer service ball. The bartender, the hostess, the servers, et al were attentive, friendly and fun. This gold glove caliber defensive team is on top of their game. Blue 32's service may even earn a spot in my Major League Bar Hall of Fame if this excellence continues. 

Base Three - Blue 32 hit a grand slam with a delicious and high-quality yet reasonably priced menu. The food was excellent and definitely a home run with Matt and I. Matt ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy, which he raved about. And I'm not a sandwich person but this one looked so good - packed to the brim with crispy shrimp and accompanied by some real stand out onion rings. I ordered the grilled salmon dish with rice and broccoli, and I was shocked. Not by the rice and broccoli, as it was good, but my goodness it was the salmon! For about $15, this salmon is blacked and grilled perfectly, not over cooked or chewy at all and it was so moist! Bar salmon that actually tastes good? I'm in.

Home Base - Overall, Blue 32 just has a superior sports watching atmosphere. It gives off high class sports bar vibes as its sparkling clean compared to other places. I am so excited to come back that I'll probably skip a couple of the other bars in my rotation. The d√©cor, lighting and seating are all set up for an ultimate fan like me. This place even has excellent parking, a wonderful patio and the interior is large but it isn't gaping. It's the perfect size. I even love the full-size bar area with lights underneath. On one of the walls there's an awesome sports ticker with stats and breaking news. They also have an excellent happy hour with really fantastic deals from 4-7pm, so it fits my after work schedule. Even their cocktail, beer and wine menu gets the job done.

Well Blue 32, your versatility has earned you starter status. I'm counting on you when I've got some serious game watching to do - and you better not disappoint. Your 5 star contract is riding it. I've got high expectations, and a great feeling that you'll succeed as the big bat in my Scottsdale sports bar lineup.",5,SMcA6UByQkgTcliNObM1-A

Having recently returned to Alize for a meal that was good, but again marred by service errors and a clientele that often lacks the class befitting such cuisine, it was with high hopes that I sat down to dinner in Andre Rochat's eponymous Monte Carlo dining room where a more serene space saw Chef Christopher Bulen send forth a feast worth feting, all four courses as refined as the environs with several classics still capable of eliciting wows.

Bearing Andre's name, but assuredly Bulen's kitchen as the young Chef reinvigorates the menu seasonally with new concepts joining Rochat's classic French plates, it was with pleasant smiles that myself and a friend were greeted at the hostess stand and led through the bar to a table dressed in linen an a la carte experience was almost entirely self-selected, the welcoming glasses of bubbly soon followed by an amuse of Veal Broth perfumed in Black Truffles plus fresh baked Bread with Butter, my companion easily encouraged to indulge in the signature ""Marti Foie"" that was every bit as lovely as I'd remembered.

Far less ridiculously priced than the imported French giants at Caesars' or MGM, several items from the $10 ""Small Plates"" section actually a bargain when taking into account both quality and amount, those looking for something vegetarian are highly encouraged to consider peppery Caponata while omnivores may wish to experience garlic laced frog legs that slip straight from bone to palate, Christopher's passion for housemade meats showing in supple white sausage or creamy pork spread, the former served along with ethereal puff pastry and one of three sausages made in house daily.

Again offering a complimentary education in wine pairings, the prior visit actually leaving me a bit overwhelmed given a low tolerance, slow sips were taken of small pours including an outstanding 2011 Sauternes that arrived to announce two highly anticipated plates, the Classic French Onion Soup more classic and meaty than Mark Purdy's at Alize but a bit lost in the mix when set next to seared Foie Gras plus a Terrine, the latter 'au naturale' with jam and toast for spreading while the warm steak saw the caramelized exterior give way to silken luxury, the combination of Rhubarb Streusel, melted Marshmallow and Balsamic faintly reminiscent of Peanut Butter and Jelly.

Taking one classic, one favorite and a generous $9 side of Sweet Potato Spaetzle for the final round of savories it was admittedly a bit disappointing that the Dover Sole was presented under a silver dome rather than being fileted table-side, but with that quibble noted it certainly did not detract from the moist flesh and light sauce Amandine, the rosy Duck undoubtedly a more hearty plate with dark rice sopping up all the pan jus as encased liver and force meat used delicate spicing to impart levity in a truly rich sausage.

Personally well sated as my dining partner questioned just how many bites he had left it was at the Chef's suggestion that three 'new-to-me' cheeses were presented along with 20 Year Tawny Port, the Beltane offering creamy complexity well matched to the accoutrements while Camembert washed in  Calvados was quite pungent unless appreciated bite for bite with pickled fruit or fig jam.

Offering desserts from Tammy Alana, easily one of the most under-appreciated names working in pastry nationwide, there was little doubt after the Cadbury masterpiece of Easter 2014 that a Souffle had to be ordered, the cloudy 'carrot cake' cleverly complimented with cream cheese Anglaise while four more sweets also joined the party, a poached pear not exactly my favorite when paired to chocolate while the Cheesecake bathed in fruit syrup ate several times lighter than any ""New York"" version, the Bourbon tinged Fondant expectedly rich as a trio of Raspberry Profitteroles crackled to the tooth atop Meyer Lemon Cream.",10,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

I scored myself a 3 veggie plate ( I chose fried squash, green beans and yams) with a roll, and a side of ranch for dippin' fried squash for a fiver and change. The fried squash were thin, hot and crispy. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte ( since Louis's is technically in Harrisburg) and the green beans were tasty too. I'm not well versed in yams but I like mine a touch more al dente than how they serve them up here but that's just a minor critique since they still tasted good.

Still unsure how they escaped. Unfortunately, our pup was ultimately struck by an oncoming vehicle on a main road. She was is bad shape and in need of serious care. We rushed her to 1st Pet and they took her in immediately. After about 2 hours, Dr. Lindgren informed us that our pup had major constusions/lacerations on her lungs and a broken arm. She was in critical condition. While I applaud their haste, I very much disliked the lack of emotion and the complete disregard Lindgren had for our situation. She seemd to be the type of vet who there for the paycheck and nothing further. She did take care of our dog thou, so it was fairly confusing. We arrived at 3pm and at 9pm, we left knowing only that our dear pup was on the dlfence and was either going to be coming home or going to rest externally. Of course, it was an emotional night for my wife and I. Thankfully, our daughter was at an overnighter and wasn't privy to the situation.

Obviously, we were elated and so, so, so happy to be bringing our fur baby home. We can't thank 1st Pet enough for their immediately, consistent care.",2,G8xV77aDTO8muZQjOi9EdQ

Dolce has a ton of different flavours to make sure that your taste buds are adequately satisfied. We often switch between this location and the one in little Italy.

The ice cream here is very flavourful and decently creamy. You'll be able to stuff your tummy with a couple of scoops and not feel sick afterwards. Both their cream based and fruit based flavours so no matter which flavour you go with you should be happy with your choice.

Usually the staff here is nice but you might have to wait a while in order to get your ice cream. The lines can get pretty long during the afternoon and their option to let customers try out different flavours can delay the process a bit more. 

Took off one star because on some days during the weekend they do not have the option to order the containers which is strange because they allow this during the weekdays. This often causes quite an inconvenience as my boyfriend and I like to stock up on ice cream for the week but we have to visit other shops in order to do so.

If the sun is getting to you and you need a nice little snack to cool you down then I definitely recommend giving Dolce Gelato a try!",0,3F2c-JFRK58dfsjdvaUlNQ

I was told this place does not serve egg whites, and I was confused because I got those last time I ate here. I told the waitress that egg yolk makes me sick, and a neighboring customer chimed in to inform me of the chicken egg shortage. 

I asked, can't you remove the yolk? They said ""no"" and ""we are very busy"", and the waitress said I can speak wth the manager. At this point the neighboring customers and few workers were listening in and watching, I felt uncomfortable and left. Couldn't but wonder, is this everywhere in AZ? We have no problems in California.

I wanted to see and called a nearby restaurant (4 minutes away from this place) and the manager said they serve egg whites, and removing the yolk was easy and possible to do. Why couldn't the Henhouse do the same? Do they serve egg beaters or some other egg alternative, hindering them to do so? I wouldn't know cause I only got ""no"" and ""we can't"" and ""we are busy"" and the final ""you can speak to our manager"".

My advice to the restaurant: Please post on your menu - WE DO NOT SERVE EGG WHITES - To avoid costumers feeling put in the spot. Please don't make them feel like they have to explain why they can't eat something, certainly in front of other costumers. 

FYI: OTHER CLOSE RESTAURANTS SERVE EGG WHITES, JUST CALL",5,WAVkK9nOHwEAHziAkhRBgg

Firstly, the ambiance is ok, very modern, lots of metallic and dark colors.  There's only one bathroom per gender, and the door is frosted glass, which is a little unnerving for me.  

You receive a paper menu and you ""build-your-own-burger"" or select one of their specialty items like the Juicy Lucy, which according to my friend, was fantastic.

I got a meatless, bunless burger, with mushrooms, asparagus (special topping, costs more), provolone, onions, and the vinaigrette dressing.  So I guess I essentially got a salad LOL.  The meatless burger was hands-down the best veggie burger I've ever had.  Don't know what was in it, but it was dense, and full of flavor.

The onion strings were pretty good, except they're super greasy.  My fingers were soaked with oil after every bite :-/  The fries were not so greasy, and just as delicious.

There are shoe and boot selections here and although given that most leather products are from Spain or Italy.  It feels like they are products of days gone by and in a way they are, the shoeboxes that they come in look like remnants from the 70s.

The store also offers bags and purses but some of these are just strewn on the floor.  In fact if you look under the benches to try on shoes you will see scattered boots and shoes under the bench as if someone was too lazy to put them away or there is no storage in the backroom.

The food is definitely unique from a restaurant perspective. It is the dairy side of traditional Kosher cooking which includes loads of carbs, dairy, veggies, and seafood. You won't find any meat from land animals so while the overall meal may not be vegetarian perfection, it is a dream come true for Pescetarians. That being said, most options are vegetarian-friendly so don't be turned off by the few fishy options.

What really adds a bit of extra to this experience is that they always have Klezmer musicians playing a set that starts in the late morning. More entertaining though is the opening act which is always the owner of the restaurant going up on stage and sharing her story of how she started the brunch buffet and teaching the audience a little bit about Ashkenazi culture and humor. It's a real treat! :D

The food is very good although it can be a tad pricey even for an all you can eat. I would suggest that if you enjoy bunch style meals, you should give this place at least one try. If it's your think, you will no doubt become a regular. :)",0,Qku2_2s2rXOj5BxkuHp0EA

To me, that is not a big enough discount to warrant buying such boring purses. I guess you can call me cheap but I would rather pay less and have a stylish purse that might fall apart within a year or pay about a hundred dollars more (300.00) and go to a normal coach store and get a purse I love that apparently also is of a better quality. Not only that, this outlet store doesnt have nearly enough employees for the amount of people that visit here. If I had even had a question, there is no way I would have had it answered. It was weird because at the Coach store at Ceasars, the sales girl was a little too attentive and came off as fake.

This outlet store was not only an unpleasant shopping experience but it also didnt seem like a real great deal price wise to me.

My first stylist was Ana and she did a great job with my hair, taught me a bunch of strategies on how to keep my hair from looking limp (I have very fine hair) and styled it very nicely when I told her I was going to a party after! The second time Ana was fully booked on that day so I had tried a new stylist, her name is Paulina. Great girl and loved her! Although more pricey than Ana, she did a super amazing job when I told her I wanted to chop my hair down to shoulder length and to do something nice with my fringe... I didn't give her much to work on because I didn't know myself what I wanted exactly, but she did such an amazing job figuring out what looked great on me that I got a million compliments at work the next day :)

Furthermore, the bang trim is complimentary and so I just walked in one day and got Michelle (I think that was her name... ?) To cut my bangs. I was doing a really poor job of describing how Paulina had done it, but she was super patient with me and didn't touch my hair until she UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY what I wanted. I was very grateful to her for her patience and keeping my happiness her first priority.

Lastly,  I have also had the opportunity to get my hair cut and had an updo done by Asha. By far the most priciest stylist that's ever cut my hair but again worth every penny. To get your hair done exactly the way you want it to be done can never beat out risky $30 cuts at random asian  salon.

This past weekend I had a surprise Birthday party for my girlfriend at the Volume Lounge.  Honestly, this place was great.  The staff was very helpful,friendly and accommodating throughout the process of planning this party and the party itself.  I had around 60 people in total show up for the party and the Volume Lounge definitely had ample space.  The VL also had up to date DJ equipment so it was very easy to run the equipment and play music.  Also if you are tight on money and a DJ is not an option, the setup is very user friendly.  My friends and I had a blast at the Volume Lounge and have talked about getting together once or twice a year just to have a party there for everyone to catch up.  

The drinks are well priced, and it is a place with no judgement.  So if you wear a suit or a hoodie and boots you will be welcomed.   If you are ever thinking about having a party for something........ Think about the Volume Lounge as you will not regret it.

If you read nothing else in this review, there are 3 words every Unique shopper should memorize - ""Half Price Mondays.""  Yes, on Mondays, everything in the store is 1/2 price.  You WILL be joined by every other
savvy bargain-shopper, the working poor, single mom's with screaming kids, and others from the fabric of Cleveland life.  It is worth it.  Trust me.

Having grown up right around the corner, when I was in high school, I indulged my mid - 1980s John Hughes inspired hipster self perception by buying a couple dozen, vintage cardigan sweaters.  REALLY nice cardigan sweaters that I am sure came from some old man's closet once he passed away.  As I grew older, I passed those cardigans along to other thrift stores in Boston, New Haven, Chicago and Denver ... but as I edge ever closer to ""old man-hood"" myself, I wish I had some of those vintage 1960's, pure wool cardigans again. 

I, myself, have a fetish for old kitchen implements and have always found Unique (this one and the one on West 25th) to be a complete treasure trove - the Le Creuset steamer I have in my kitchen (purchased for $1. 10  on 1/2 price Monday - Google ""Le Creuset"" to get a sense of the bargain on this one) is testament to that.  

When I lived in Cleveland and had guests visit, a Monday tour of the W. 25th and Fulton Uniques was always scheduled.  Out of town friends were always amazed at the things they found.  You can also feel good that you are keeping things out of landfills and supporting a charitable organization.  And - of course - finding unique, interesting items that will elicit gasps from your hipster friends when they ask ""OH. MY. GOD.  Where did you find THAT.  It's so cool.""  And you can reply, with a small, secretive smile: ""Oh, just some little speciality shop down near Tremont.  It's a one-of-a-kind, you know.""",4,WUb8KUdRjdOzA2TVNke9Ow

The ordering process was a bit awkward to me with the salad bar (this is NOT like Panera). It seemed a bit unnecessary, but that might just be my Panera fandom talking.

The prices are akin to Panera in that... it's overpriced. Don't get me wrong though; the food and service was all great, but it's just difficult to swallow a $10+ price on a half-and-half lunch combo.

After about 2 days of deciding, we finally chose this spot since it was on our way home from work. It's your typical bar with another section designated for non smoking diners. We decided to sit on that side since it was much more quiet and we wanted to catch up over food and drinks. 

My friend orders a screwdriver, which you can't really mess up. I order a vodka (Tito's) and water with lime. I get my drink and it had a lemon instead. No biggie. I take a sip, it's ALL water. I let my friend taste it to make sure I wasn't just being a raging alcoholic since I'm used to stronger drinks. She agreed that it had almost no alcohol. Our waitress was super sweet and had the bartender add more Tito's. 

We order our food and I opt for the fish and chips with coleslaw. My friend had the salmon, which she said was good. Mine on the other hand was just eh. The fish had good texture and was moist but the breading just came right off. It was so much breading too that I just ended up with a thin strip of fish. The French fries were undercooked and soggy. The coleslaw was soggy from the beginning, probably because  it was pre-made and had way too much mayo. For dessert, we opted for bread pudding with caramel sauce. This was delicious. It was soft, but not too soggy and wet. And the caramel sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. 

The owner came around a few times to make sure that everything was well. He was this sweet older man and I appreciated the gesture. Our waitress was sweet as well, always coming by to check on us. You could tell this is a favorite spot for locals because the employees knew a lot of customers' names when they walked in.

I was so BLESSED to have you at both of 2 of my children's birth. (2010 and 2013)
The last birth was so fast, after having my water ruptured for many days, in which you gave me all the support (emotionally and physically as I needed them). IT was the best experience ever. You gave me all the support we needed during the prenatal checks and tests, always answering all our questions. My kids loved coming to the check ups, assisting you during measurements of baby, making them feel so special, too.
I am so glad that I found you some years ago. I knew, that you are a very competent midwife, having the knowledge what to do. You helped me turn successfully my baby, so I had NO breach birth at home, even when I was not afraid to  have one in case that would have happened (as it has happened before when I lived in MD). Also knowing that you could have helped me with that, took away any fear.
Marvelys is truly the midwife anyone is looking for. Also the postpartum time with you was wonderful. You took care of assisting me to have success with breastfeeding. For the first time, I could breastfeed over 12 month. At first I had difficulties, as the baby did not gain weight so fast, but you had great tips, how to get my milk fatty, and it worked.

Anywho, hotels.com was advertising 2 nights for $161. SouthPointe was advertising $212. WTH? Also an issue left over from last year was the fact that since they didn't sell out (and won't this year either), the price dropped in half the week of SuperBowl, but I couldn't take advantage of it.

I loved the look, I loved the location, I loved the people who were working there, the decor was amazing, but the one thing that made me give 4 stars instead of 5 is the bathrooms were outside the main venue hall.  They were located near the elevator.  They were nice bathrooms inside their own space, I just did not like that I had to leave the main event area.
I would suggest this place to others though.  Great location!",0,Ht8lEQKD9tG7_2KnsZ4slg

This place has a terrific selection of beers on tap and even more terrific selection of beers in bottles... and you can scrawl through their entire suds menu on an iPad. which is very cool.

My friends and I booked it directly for Public House after arriving in Sin City following a harrowing drive (even though we left LA at 2:30, we still battled some of the worst holiday traffic I've ever battled). We got a round of Ballast Point's reliably delicious Sculpin from the taps, then ordered a few bottles. We tried the overpriced but tasty Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (it was $26 for a not that big bottle) and Green Flash's Le Freak (a mutant combination of a Belgian Trippel and an American IPA), both delicious. I wasn't hungry because I'd eaten on the road, but my friend ordered their Burger and Fries and I tried a few bites... good stuff.

The decor was fun, basically a hip and winky American vibe with Vinyl Lincoln, Franklin, and GW Bush dolls lining the walls and a huge glass encased beer room. Our waitress was nice, but proportioned in those ridiculous Las Vegas waitress ways. So basically this place combined a hipster beer-hall you'd find in Brooklyn or Silver Lake and infused it with some singularly Vegas flourishes, which made it both silly and awesome. Definitely a great place to check out if you like good beer when you're in Las Vegas.",1,1y2dLZg2l3dtLc1nzU2qzg

The bar was actually super nice so we got seated there. 

We were immediately greeted by our server Nicole, sick tattoos btw. I've asked her about their mimosas and she said there were different types of mimosas that they can make. She listed them all and introduced this blueberry lavender mimosa that was pureeeeeeeee delicious and amazing. It was definitely something that we both haven tried before. The taste of it was just amazing and perfect for brunch. 

I've ordered the eggs Benedict and my best friend ordered the crab cake Benedict's. The food came super quickly and I was super impressed at how our server kept checking up on us and even filling up our cups with water without disturbing us! 

Let's talk food. My eggs Benedict was amaaaaaaazing. Delicious, I wish they were more generous with the hollandise sauce but overall it was great. The smashed potatoe hash browns were sooooo perfect. Crispy, hot and soft in the inside. I loved how they also saut√©ed other veggies with the hash. It was delicious. I think I would get the crab cake Benedict's next time, my friend said it was amazing and something she has never ordered before. 

When I asked for the bill, Nicole our server totally surprised us with a birthday treat for my friend. We were so awed with the surprise that it totally made our day. Plus we would definitely be coming back just to snack on those donuts. It was pure goodness. 

Can't wait to try their fried chicken next time.

I've never been treated so poorly by a restaurant manager. I called in a ""to go"" order and was told to pick it up in 15 mins. My wife waited patiently in the restaurant for 35 mins and asked repeatedly when our order would be ready. She was told that a catering order came in and that our two entree order had to wait until the catering order was finished. At 40 min mark I spoke the the shift manager and told him this was unacceptable. Instead of any hint of an apology he corrected me by telling me I had only waited 34 mins. Once again I explained that this was unacceptable to which he accused me of being rude. He told me that he was going to comp my order but he was no longer b/c I was ""rude"". He told us that if we didn't like how it was being handled that we should go somewhere else which we would have except that we had already paid. It's not okay to take money from a customer then treat them with such disrespect. No respect for our time and definitely did not value us as customers. Come to find out they got our order wrong.

When I drove up, I really didn't know what to think. It's in a plaza with a Harris Teeter, and some other random shops. Not to mention there is another Chinese place right next door. 
When we arrived, there was a line out the door! I was shocked... how in the world could this be? two places right by each other and this one has a myriad of hungry folks drooling over the menu while the other sits empty. We gave the hostess our name and headed outside to wait for our name to be called. While you're sitting there, you are teased by a stand with a tray filled with delicious looking goodness. 
Finally our name gets called and we head into the tiny restaurant. I decided on the honey chicken which came in one of those awesome trays with all the compartments I'd seen outside. Sweet! It was only $6.95 so I figured I couldn't go wrong for that.
When she brought me that food, Oh man... was I excited. It had the honey chicken, mixed with veggies and honey shrimp. 2 crab ran goons, a salad & the most amazing rice I've ever had. OK, I know you're thinking... Um, Beth it's just rice. NO!!! You don't understand. I think it has magical powers of delicious proportions. When I tried the first bite of honey chicken, I seriously think the clouds above parted and angels started to sing. 
Most people go for the sushi, and I've gone 3 times with the intentions of trying the sushi, but dang that honey chicken is good, and I can't imagine not having it!!! Everyone I know who's had the sushi has LOVED it though, so it's a high priority in my life to try it. Most of the time I end a review saying I'll go back soon or something to that effect, but with this one I'm thinking to myself...Uh, can I go back NOW?!?

- group of 4, including one foodie and one japanese person

Had (prices available online):
- tonkotsu shiyo; charcoal miso ramen special, japanese poutine, gyoza

Pros:
- lots of options you can't find at the other Toronto ramen spots - e.g. Japanese poutine (japanese mayo, teriyaki, nori); charcoal miso ramen special
- on the whole, is a ""cheaper"" ramen spot (especially when you throw potion size into the mix), not that it's cheaper by much (although, the gyoza is a total steal at $2.5/5 pc)
- lots of space (much bigger than the other spots)
- a ""lighter"" options (given that this is ramen we're talking about), like the clear chicken soup base instead of tonkotsu (pork bone) and their pork shoulder is not fatty at all

Cons:
- a ""lighter"" option - one of my friends considered it too light (prefers the fattier pork & soup at Kinton/Santouka)
- relatively more salty
- not a lot of choice in ramen (i.e. can't choose soup richness like at Kinton), although there's lots of toppings you can add; and no ""sets"" (think Santouka)

Overall impression:
- personally I would come here more often than Kinton and Santouka, because on a general basis, I prefer lighter soup bases (less rich, fatty). However, if you don't care about that, then the soup base is actually much tastier at Santouka and if I wasn't eating ramen a lot, I'd pick Santouka or Sansotei, which has the best balance IMO.
- if you did come, would suggest the charcoal special over the pork bone soup base.
- portion sizes are closer to Kinton than Santouka (i.e. larger)",0,fIOqAzILMhIMTYmdbGWlNw

Ad for it on Yelp. I was going back and forth between 4 stars and 5, but the new, different appetizers and rolls made it!

Location: 
pretty central, and close to UNLV. I live on the East side and didn't mind the drive. Easy to get to and when we got there for dinner, the area had lots of parking spaces available. 

Atmosphere: 
Smaller area & Casual with an open vibe (lots of windows make up 2 of the 4 walls), dark floors/tables. A mix of chairs and stools against the wall. Similar to Sakana. There's a bar towards the front that seat about 6 leopl

Service: 
our waitress and the chefs were very friendly! Our waters were always refilled in a timely manner and when our waitress was busy, one of the chefs brought it to our table. It did take some time to get some of our rolls/appetizers, but luckily the vibe was calm in the restaurant which made us less impatient. 

Food: 
THIS is what gets the stars. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is generous and awesome! And Honestly, it was the variety of different appetizers & rolls that other restaurants rarely have that they do. 
-Cucumber rolls! (Rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice)
-Ono Special box roll! 
-Hirata bun (pork belly in baos)
-Pork Belly Taco
-Poke Tacos
-Seared salmon miso nigiri
-Scalloped wrapped in bacon skewers (others have this, but here it's much bigger in size and Less burnt crispy)
-Fried octopus (better than crispy calamari!) 
-Takoyaki 
-Truffle fries
Price: 
Similar to other AYCE sushi places, but actually a bit cheaper. Other places I've been to charge as high as 26.95 for dinner and here it is 24.98! Way better deal and still a good sushi experience. 

I would definitely try this place out at least once and try something that you wouldn't have been able to try at other places. :)",7,sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA

1bls Shrimp -Mild house special style

Years ago, some guys from my office got lunch here every so often. They raved about it, so I figured I'd go see what the fuss was all about. I randomly picked a couple of items from the menu: combo with #1 and #13 (carnitas and pollo diablo; pork fried rice and black beans). I was a goner from the first bite. 

I eventually changed my habitual order to replace #1 with #14 (machaca), but otherwise, I have never strayed. It's just so good, I don't want to even try anything else. I can understand why they have so many awards and mentions on their walls.

Why I love it:

1) It's just plain GOOD. There's nothing else (that I know of) that's like it. You know when you have a unique favorite recipe, or a certain brand & flavor of ice cream that's incomparable to anything else, and when you're in the mood for it, nothing else will do? (Think ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).

2) Unpretentious. I'm a reverse snob: frou frou ""nouveau"" this or that really rubs me the wrong way. This place, a hidden jewel in an otherwise anonymous strip mall, is as down to earth as it gets. No fancy, uber-glam  seating here. 

3) Friendly staff.  This amazes me. They work lightning-fast, in a hot, steamy, loud, confined space, but they're always peppy and cheerful. No soup-nazis here.

Apparently, so does Wolfgang Puck.  

The ambiance is chic with a touch of classic rock and roll (we heard Pink Floyd, the Stones, Elton John, etc. while eating which was a nice touch).  As a side note, ladies be careful; like many of the newer Vegas restaurants, the floors were slick wood, and I had to be assisted multiple times when walking to and from the table in order to avoid an embarrassing CL fall.

Cut is one of the best steakhouses I've visited, food wise, and I can honestly attested to the fact that everything is good.  I can't speak for the flan, but do yourself a favor and get the steak tartare and the jalapeno margarita to start (obviously not together).  My husband and his brother both ordered the petit cut filet, which was good, buy I got the American Wagyu filet, and the only word I can come up with is amazing.  The steak was so good that I barely remember eating the sides (for the record, the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were also delicious).

All in all, Cut is pricey, but well worth it for any steak-loving foodie.",1,qLsTb1otLqxrNWNZGm-eJA

MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,1,2011-12-18 04:07:39,4,eFVyN4USt9tudNGY37QFfg,"I saw this place a few weeks ago anticipating its grand opening, but was greatly disappointed. I heard it was going to be a Canton Tea Restaurant (), but boy was I wrong. This is yet another typical Las Vegas Chinese restaurant with the same menu as everybody else in town (BBQ King, HK Star, etc.). There is nothing Canton or even HK style about this restaurant. They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. 

We came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order. For veggies, they only had lettuce, nothing else, and they wanted to charge $7 for it. Seriously? SF supermarket is right next door. Is it that hard to walk over and buy some ingredients?

We ended up ordering two clay pots (which the waiter recommended we order because it would feed up to five people), but when it came, it looked look they were pizza hut personal pan style servings. The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().

We also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the ""wok air"" (). We were still hungry, so we ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice. That was decent, but portion was small. 

Service: This is the most disappointing part of the experience. I understand it's their second day of operation, but the waiters literally looked like they just started working there for the very first time. Menus were not given to us immediately when we sat down. We had to remind them to give us the basic utensils and napkins. Tea was not promptly refilled when we were out. They literally didn't study their own menu. We ordered by dish name and they didn't know what the menu item # was or where to find it. This might be a pet peeve of mine, but I've NEVER EVER received my receipt in the check book thingy upside down.

Honest to say, I'll never come here again and would not recommend anybody to come here. The only thing they have going for them are the decorations, which makes the interior better looking than before (Ay Chung).",6,IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw

Reviews were not great from this Meineke but I went for a simple oil change to check them out myself.  They were so kind and welcoming I felt like their friend.  Johnny pointed out to me my struts were blown out and needed immediate attention (I already knew this, it was part of the test).  He gave me a very fair estimate and I scheduled the service.  He even worked with me on a ride while my car was in for the day.  I am so happy I have found my car care expert.

Food: For appetizers, get the empanadas! If you love potatoes like me, you will enjoy this dish a lot!! Marinated beef and potatoes in pockets of fried deliciousness- yes, please! You must order an arepa as well! I got the chicken one this time around, which was good. I think next visit I'll have to get it with some chorizo, mmmh. The portions are also fairly big, so it's hard to leave hungry...unless you are a big hungry bear in disguise. I also tried the cheesy corn, which was a bit too heavy for me. But if you are in the mood for something rich and filling, and you love cheese and corn, this dish is perfect for you! Also, you must try their four different house made sauces. My favorite is the pineapple, because you can actually taste pineapple in it...and it's not some watery pineapple flavoring liquid. The saltiness of the chips, and the sweetness of the pineapple is great!

The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal.

First, the food was nowhere close to authentic Indian food.
We had ordered several items on the menu ranging from north Indian cuisine, south Indian cuisine to Indo chinese. None of the food items were flavorful for what they were. 

Schzewan rice was very bland - no hint of vinegar or soy sauce or garlic. Samosa chat was dry and soft, the crunch was completely missing.

To top it all, the servers were rude and paid little attention. We had been waiting for one item that we ordered and kept waiting until we could wait no more and decided to leave because of the the main servers asked us to ""empty the table"" as other people were waiting for a table.

Sienna Mercato is located Downtown Pittsburgh slightly north of the Cultural District. My aunt and I enjoyed beer (my last for 31 days) and each ordered a la carte meatballs (2 pesto, 2 marinara) and also enjoyed the Poutine (potatoes with cheese). Though all tasty, this experience felt more like a quick business lunch more than a celebratory birthday dinner. We were seated at a wobbly table in the center of the restaurant when many more intimate options were available. I'm not being passive-aggressive, just honest about the ""experience."" The highlight was a shared order of pecan balls that were sooooo delicious (a bit frozen, so obviously pre made).

Around this same time last year, the customer service was horrible and it was incredibly difficult to get ANY weekend/evening appointments. The technicians were always different and they always seemed to miss several spots. If I had a rare/majestic evening appointment, it would always get cancelled due to lack of staff. I think I waited 4 months to actually start my first treatment due to cancellations.

Fast forward half a year, and things have really changed at this place. I've had no problem getting an evening appointment 6-weeks out like I'm supposed to. The staff is much better trained, and I am usually only between two different technicians that never miss a spot. I'm not completely done with my treatments, but I haven't had the need to shave in weeks. It's really nice just being able to strut my legs without worrying about if they're hairy or not. I got a really good deal on my services, and even with the mishaps the first few months, I am entirely satisfied with my experience.

But,  this is all ok, its just par for the course. (I did fall for it, but I remember the Alamo!...so to speak).

What is Modern Burger @ PHX Int. Airport?

- Modern fastfood, modern only in name, high price being its true differentiator (relative to twin arches).  

- Small seating area accommodates those wishing to dwell...Kitty corner view of TV at neighboring edtablishment 

- Music - The Feelies ""Modern Rythms"", a pioneer of the early 89s alternative sound, true standout!  
      - http://www.thefeeliesweb.com
      - (thank you Shazam!)
      - TY MB!..you've totally redeemed yourself!

- Double Bacon Cheese Burger - LTO...greasy, cheesy mess...taste is closest to 5 Guys...I prefer grilled patties to the fried variety....they forgot the L and T so I got that on the side, upside was it was cold..(Take note MB, that's how Root Burger does it, works!)... overall ok, I'd hoped for better.

- Chocolate shake was basically unmemorable and totally bland

I wish i could remember her stage name because i feel obligated to warn the world about her.
Not my favorite strip club but not the worst one either.
Most of the girls are terrible at giving lapdances.  Probably the worst place to get a lapdance.  This one chick had a little routine.  She would do her thing then stand up, clap her hands, then step and spin, then will slam her ass on my lap repeatedly to the point where all i can feel is her ass bone on my lap.  Then she would repeat the whole routine again and after the song ended she asked if i wanted another.  I passed.  It was kind of weird/awkward.

-  I told them I've only been to nail salon 2 times before that I know nothing about getting my nails done when I got there.
- I brought several photo of what I am going for.

- Sample color and actual color was VERY different. (Picked white, and somehow it turned to be lilac color)
- They asked me how do I like them, so I told them honestly that I didn't expect dip power would be so obvious and uneven that I don't really like it. She sounds frustrated at me, and workers and a regular customer started telling me that they like them.
- They suggested other color and it will be better and that'll be closer to what I want. I still tried on my thumb, but the color was so off from I'm going for, but at this point, I knew they can't deliver anything I'm looking for, so I gave up and told her to leave it. She said she can't just leave one color on so she is putting the first color back on.
- By the way, she made me bleed 3 times. 3rd one happened when she was fixing my thumb, and looking my nail right now, my blood stained in my nail because she did it so many times that she didn't deal with it properly on the last one.
- My co-worker told me about this place (but in different location) and dipping powder gel. Hers is amazing even though she also has lighter color. I was telling them about her nails and the lady says ""you should have told me. Take a photo of her nails next time!"" ......... tell you what? First of all I don't want the exact nail color, second, I showed them so many photos of what I like. I mentioned I need help picking colors because I don't have experience that I don't know how it turns. 
- The lady DID say that she didn't know how the color would turn on actual nails, and so as why the sample number and actual bottle number didn't match.

I know a lot of people loving this place, even customers I talked to while I was there were loving here. Not sure if the lady wasn't professional enough or not familiar with dip powder gels, or... I don't know. But stop frustrating at ME just because she painted completely different from what I asked for.

Definitely a new experience because this restaurant is Asian fusion and what a great idea it is... a chinese burger. lol 

First off, Garlic. Parmesan. Truffle FRIES. Best one I've had yet. The truffle oil/sauce they sprinkle over the fries are just so delicious.. and the tomato dipping sauce? Damn. I also wanted to get the oxtail fries.. but I think I would've exploded or something.. I pretty much breathed the truffle fries in, cause it was so good lol I ordered the Black & Greens burger with wagyu beef (grass fed beef) and it was definitely a noticeably good quality beef. And the way they marinated brought out so much (asian) flavor on top of the caramelized onions and mushrooms.. I could barely finish it cause how filling it was (I also blame the fries).

Mine was a bacon cheeseburger, and it didn't have much bacon flavor or cheese flavor.  The fries were fine, but no better than the typical burger take-out joint.

She recommended the renowned margaritas, and my wife tried the Paradise Rita and I tried the Chambord Rita.  Both were delicious and refreshing and $1 off due to happy hour.  We had also noticed that wine bottles were half price on Tuesday nights on the way in, and we sprung for the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, and it was crisp and fruity in spite of being a screw top.  For our free appetizer, we got the table side guac, and Stephanie mixed it up at the table, but I noticed she did not use all of the pre-measured salt and pepper and it could have used it.  Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.  As Stephanie was packing up the leftovers for us, two slices of cornbread baptized the table next door, and she brought us a whole cornbread in its place (packed safely we assume in the kitchen!).

I am not suffering from an illness, I am just preemptively taking care of my body and I have started doing HBOT weekly as a way to pamper myself, although it is not as near as pleasant sa a  massage. HBOT is currently an experiment for me to see how my body reacts.  So far i like it.  I feel a slight tingling in my limbs when I'm done with a session, and I feel extra alert and clear in my thoughts.  A little like the main character in the movie, Limitless.  It is a good feeling.  

HBOT as I have read about it doesn't have many measurable short term effects, but over a long period is when positive effects supposedly manifest.  The mainstream medical community only use HBOT for wound healing.  I believe it is mostly commonly used in conventional hospitals for chemotherapy and radiation recovery.  Chiropractors and holistic health places like Serenity, offer it to those of us who want a taste.

So I'm taking my time and expecting little, and just trying to be mindful of any changes.  Of course this is perfect bait for me to spend a lot of money on something that may not be too effective.  We'll see...

There are many athletes who make HBOT part of their routines which include:  Novak Djokovic, Tim Tebow, Darren Sharper, James Harrison, Terrell Owens and Hines Ward.

Kate is always the one to greet me at Serenity HBOT, so say, ""Hi, and mention this review."" I'm trying to talk her into a discount for any referrals she gets.",1,yAdnKwB8ReKDY-0po46Thw

This is my first time being asked to pay for some extra pickles at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga. 

Another time when I got 8 falafels, I asked the owner for more tahini sauce because one very small container of taihini didn't seem enough to cover all the falafels. He seemed unimpressed and told me that they give only 1 container of tahini for every 4 falafels - proving to himself that he should have given me 2 containers of tahini for my 8 falafels in the first place, instead of just one!

From my perspective, the place is nicely decorated, clean and has a nice vibe to it. Tables are pretty close together but the emptiness allows you a lot of privacy. Not a bad place for a date :)
Service is a bit slower than expected as only one waitress works there. Not the best thing, but when the place is so empty you really don't need more. We got served and used the waiting time as a nice moment to chit chat with my girlfriend. 
The sushi mix plate was quite nice - not mind blowing, but did the trick (I will admit I am not a sushi fan). I had the yellow thai curry and my gf had the vegetarian pad thai.

I was so fortunate to win 5 tickets to Brat Haus' September 17th Oktoberfest event at the Yelp Pawfect Day Event at Paws Commons. Thank you, Hailey B.!. I rustled friends and went to the event. We got there at around 5 pm after doing a little shopping in Old Town Scottsdale. The shops there are super charming.

Tip: While some stations accepted credit card, doing Oktoberfest is much smoother with cash. We walked over to Walgreen's and got some Greenbacks. After reading up on the Brat Haus on Yelp, I decided to try the HEFEWEISSBIER which had a nice wheat flavor. Very drinkable!

I loved my grilled das brat, a footlong bratwurst served in a pretzel bun. It was amazing with their house dijon mustard and sauerkraut. I also enjoyed the gouda soft pretzel with beer cheese sauce. I wanted dessert but had absolutely no room left.

For entertainment, we enjoyed the fellow Oktoberfest revelers. We witnessed the brat eating contest and left around the Badass Beard Contest. We could barely see the contestants for the Lederhosen and Dirndl Contests. It was crowded and festive. Our servers were friendly and welcoming. We were lucky to purchase the last Das Brat. I have to think about coming in costume next year (free admission).",12,9gZ4pQHdK6v8xMLig6EEFA

My wife has done crab legs and crab; I've done the Crawfish. We've both done the Shrimp. 

My suggestion; stay with the shrimp. Order it to your spice level of comfort. 

I like the Cajun Fries, my wife likes the Sweet Potato Fries. 

Go early, or you will have a tough time finding parking and be greeted with a long wait. 

It is pricey, but a great eating experience. We have taken my wife's relatives and friends from Korea to this place, and they always want to come back and make it their last meal before they return to home.

Im excited because this was my first ever live boxing match and my first time ever at T and M. Was all ready to pay for parking but pleasantly found out that you didn't have to. Parking was half full but we had a disabled person with us so we got to park right in front of the arena. 

Like all hyped up epic boxing matches, there are always undercards that go before the main event so that whatever drama that has been building up since its announcement can marinate in everybody's minds. 

Of course, until the main event comes around, the arena is only half full. It's like a party atmosphere until then no matter who is on the undercard. I would say about 3/4 of the crowd were Mexican pulling for Marquez. Lots of Mexican flags being waved around not the mention all the cervezas flowing.

The sound system is nice and loud especially when they play music for introductions and videos played on the big screens. The only bad thing was that when they actually spoke into the mics, it wasn't as loud and not very clear.

What makes this a 4 instead of a 5 star review is not because of the lousy mics, its because of the lousy overall design of the parking lot logistics. Earlier, we were ecstatic because we scored a disabled parking spot. Only problem was that getting out was a total nightmare. Since we were basically parked in front of the entrance of the arena, a massive amount of attendees were all over the place walking back to their car. This was probably the only time that cars did not have the right of way. You had people all over the place walking around like zombies. Yes you had parking attendees directing you where to go but it didn't matter because the people walking around didn't care if you were trying to get out of the parking lot. They just kept on walking like there were no cars at all rolling around. This definitely has to be redesigned. Im sure this is not as bad as a problem at other arenas.

Overall, I had fun up until we had to leave. Maybe next  time we we just wont park so close to the arena. Oh btw, the fight went the full 12 rounds and Bradley won by split decision.",5,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg

Recently shopping old Belz (now Premium South Outlets), I realized that meal #4 had to go down and meal #5 was just about 120 minutes later. Here's the dilemma when you're at Belz.  It's hard to find something quick, healthy, and did I mention quick.  One good thing about Chipotle is that they have brown rice, steak, and chicken all ready for you.  For a restaurant in a busy shopping outlet, you would think this Chipotle would be busy. But this Chipotle wasn't.  I entered the premises, requested for two scoops of their chicken/brown rice and I was out with the quickness.  Roughly 10 oz of chicken for less than $10.  Now that's a big on protein and small on the wallet.  Yeah Buddy!!

PS:  I know that Chipotle is known for their burritos, specifically their barbacoa burrito.  Burritos, Schmittos.  I'm sure their good.

I just about always get the Jade Red Chicken in a Burrito and then either Machata, Carnitas or Emerald Chicken in a Quesadilla. Their Black Beans + Jerk Fried Rice as the side choices is to die for, especially mixed together. This isn't to say that any of the selections aren't excellent; I've tried just about everything and there was nothing I didn't like. A million times better than Panda Express.

Ordering is confusing for newbies but once you get the hang of it, you'll prefer it to any other form of ordering because it actually speeds things up if the customers know what they're doing. And for the customers that are confused, if they just walk up to the counter with a confused look, there's always an employee that will move to the side, explain the ordering, and give samples of the most popular items.

All hail Chinos! Here's hoping they franchise and/or continue to expand. I seriously think if the owners took a plunge or accepted investment opportunity, this could be a successful national chain. Especially if the investors provided some advice on improving the ordering and aesthetic of the restaurants, which is just about the only downside (and only a surface one).

eHvgW9qj-CsPjWmpckJeiw,0,2016-05-17 22:32:19,2,LYjUc0JrNnO9VQRE-zwZ-A,"I have to preface this review by saying my family and I have taken our cars here for years. I have had nothing but wonderful things to say about Exclusive Collision Center and have recommended them to anyone and everyone I know. Until now that is. To say I am disappointed is an understatement! I am very saddened and quite disgusted by how I was recently treated by Jeremy and his staff. 

I went to Jeremy to get an estimate on my car on 5/1/16. He welcomes me with a hug and was more than friendly and accommodating ensuring me they will take care of my car and make the process as seamless as possible, even offering to take me to the airport after I dropped off my car and return it to my house before I got back in town that Sunday. Now that's service I thought. Here's where it goes bad. 

I returned in town on Sunday to find my garage empty, my car was not delivered. This meant I couldn't go to work the next day even though Charlene ensured me she'd call that Friday with any updates. Since I didn't hear I figured all was well and I'd have my car when I returned. I called first thing Monday morning and Charlene told me my car wouldn't be done until almost close of business and that they could no longer deliver my car, I'd have to take an Uber. So, I showed up at 3:30 pm as directed only to find that only half of the work promised was completed. To boot, they had already charged my credit card for the full amount and my car was there for 7 days for a pretty minor fix. They said there was a miscommunication and they'd speak with Jeremy (who gave me the estimate) and get back to me by the latest Wed. I didn't get a call by Wed. so on Thurs. I called and was assured by Charlene that Jeremy would give me a call back. No call on Thurs. either and on Friday they were closed. So, first thing Monday morning I called and once again asked to speak to Jeremy, with no luck. At this point, I now ask for my money back for the work that wasn't done. Charlene offers for me to bring the car back, to which I told her I can't do, and once again says she'll call me that day with an update, yet no call once again. Still no call from Jeremy either. To make matters worse, they had reimbursed me for the Uber I took down to pick up my car and the check bounced and I incurred an additional charge. So, today, 5/17/16 I called back and spoke to Charlene, very upset at this point, only to be told that they did the work promised and that is that. 

WOW is all I can say! While I've had positive experiences in the past, clearly things have changed there and customer service is no longer a priority. Had Jeremy just taken the time to give me a call, perhaps we could have resolved the issue. I would be very leery of taking your car there now. It just isn't what it use to be and it'll be more trouble than the money you may save.",16,1zica6zFZWlcD8sKpaMv-g

The fries seemed fresh but very, very dark like they use old oil or something. Not my style of fries.
Service was horrible. No acknowledgment, no hi how can I help you? Nothing.
It took forever for our food and we came at a very slow time, not busy at all.
Even if you're drunk, this food would not suffice. In fact it'll probably make you yak.

Overall this place is overpriced, cheap quality and bad customer service. I do not recommend this at all.",0,_z7zi24Nc8fDeM_m5xS95A

The 10-12 beers on tap are a great balanced selection - domestic, excellent Arizona micro's, and top notch imports.  The wine list reads like the ""Best Buy list under $20"" in a wine magazine.  Which is really not a bad thing. The food is - well, its bar food.  The 2 standouts - ""air-fried"" New York style wings.  They are cooked by a special high temperature high air velocity convection oven so no grease at all, quite lean and crispy.  Second, the brewed beef and French dip sandwiches. Succulent, well spiced, tender melt in your mouth beef.  The rest of the menu - just average at best.  Avoid the Costco-burgers - grill cooked to a pasty grey tasteless waste of time. The atmosphere is casual by both the employees and customers- almost like the owners and managers are more about the idea of being bar owners and bar managers than being self aware about the business itself. The staff is friendly, like going to your neighbors for a backyard cookout, and the service is pretty much the same level.  You get the idea that the waiters-staff have little or no professional restaurant experience or skills, but one feels bad about not letting it go because they are just so like your own neighbors.  They do have entertainment, some pretty good, some not so good.  A duet called Copper Skies plays all the late 60s and 70s folk-pop ballads - pretty good.  A 3-boy teen-aged band played very very badly, like the Jonas brothers without any skills age 12-15.  It was enough to drive us away from those great beer taps and out the door. Yet some of the customers loved them, just as if your neighbors 3 sons played for you at their backyard barbecue.

JVJ9v-gFH68m6hA1NyQmbg,0,2011-04-27 19:45:25,0,7VjapRCKd6WdyvOvGNIr9g,"Terrible.

I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  

First, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  

Second, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  ""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!""  Ridiculous. 

This restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell ""order!"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  

Our waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  

The food, though... Jesus.  We started with the ""margarita shrimp cocktail"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  

My boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  

Now, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).

The description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  

It was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.

The green beans were good. 

Other people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.

I have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.",0,Mphrvw1SuAn4dMGx95MGDg

There, I said it. It feels good. 

Seriously, though. I loved this place. I loved getting my hand stamped like I was going to a concert or fair. I loved walking through the gravel and rows of cars and feeling that terrifying sinking feeling in my stomach because I knew I'd get lost. I didn't love thinking about how those poor cars died or how their owners felt when it happened, but I tried to keep that out of my head as much as possible. I loved looking up the cars in the computer and getting the slip of paper with all of the information on it, then using it as a map all over the yard. It was entirely not what I expected and such an adventure! 

We came for a wide variety of pieces and parts for 2 different cars. The man's VW and my Honda both need some work; the difference between the two is that the VW is a for-fun-beater that he's trying to fix up and play around with, my Honda is my every day car that I'm forcing not to become a beater. I've given the little guy a name and love him like a family member, so the junkyard may be my most frequented spot soon.

Yelp reviews of Phoenix area Honda and Toyota dealerships generally reflect a polarization at both ends of the rating spectrum, from which I concluded that the probability of having a good experience with any one of them was likely to be a roll of the dice.  

We visited nearly half the Honda and Toyota dealers in Phoenix, and discovered that some of them richly deserve their 1-2 star Yelp ratings.  Arrowhead Honda was (for us) one of the less impressive dealerships.  When we arrived, it was clear that some kind of promotion was underway and the showroom was quite busy.  Nevertheless, one of the salesmen approached us and initiated a dialogue.  Shortly thereafter, he was paged and asked us to ""wait 2 minutes"" at a table to allow him to respond to another customer.  Twenty (20) minutes later we were still sitting there awaiting his return.  We were unable to locate him and finally left.

I have been involved in business all of my adult life, and suspect that this is not generally how Arrowhead Honda does business.  Further, we have all experienced lapses of awareness from time to time; these things happen.  Having said that, it was annoying.",12,khFDt20fI4Pg6Yu0-1ptKQ

The menu calls it spicy, but I'd disagree and just say well flavoured; it's not ""hot"" - maybe even a little sweet from the peppers and tomatoes. If you order it definitely add the lamb sausage. You get one links worth, about half the plate in size. It really makes the dish and adds substance to it - not optional in my opinion.

Nathan F. was the plumber assigned to our job, and he proved very competent in what he did. While my husband was able to get the pilot re-lit, it would shut off after a few minutes. Nathan removed the burner assembly and vacuumed the area out with his shop-vac. Replaced the assembly, and re-lit pilot that stayed on, and on!!! Really appreciate that Nathan stayed for about 15-20 minutes after the re-light, as I was afraid he would leave, and then the pilot would again go out. Service call- diagnosis and resolution came to about $106 which I find very reasonable. 30 day warranty... Will certainly call Christian Brothers again for our next plumbing need (although I hope it's not anytime soon!).

Also want to mention how much I appreciated Ty, the dispatcher's honesty. When I called on Saturday, he said we would be on stand-by in case someone cancelled; otherwise, someone would be out on Sunday between 1:00-4:00. He could hear the disappointment in my voice, and expressed that he would rather be honest we me rather than say someone would be out, and then have to call later and say no.

Tender rib eye steak, rock crab claws, king crab legs, gigantic shrimp cocktail, oysters on the half shell, halved lobster tails, rack of lamb, prime rib, sushi, sea bass, roasted asparagus, crab cakes, mini crab frittata, mini cheese plate, mini caprese salad, mini yogurt and granola, one-bite dessert galore, and freshly made cheese popovers.  You can order cesar salad, caviar, lobster bisque, and tuna tartare, through the waitstaff.  I liked the savory items more than the sweet items.  Many of the lobster tails were too dry, the popover was a little on the doughy side, and the lobster bisque was delightful.  The chocolates at the dessert bar were tasteless and there were fruit flies hovering over the goodies.

xG2DxjHdoUf3frxogIeTAg,1,2013-09-21 13:42:47,0,Rys-sIjHrOE8mxIOUQGsrA,"I've recently did a drysuit neck gasket repair with MEC. And it is my first and last time: the experience has been an ongoing nightmare. 

When I first inquired about the repair cost, I was told it'd be $35.00. The repair was done in a timely fashion. When I went to pick it up, the cost came up to $120.00. I was in shock and had to re-budget my rent for this month for this shocking repair cost. But I did pay for it. 

A week later, the same gasket was torn. (And yes I do take care of them, my head is as small as a child and I even sanded down my nails to prevent any harm to the suit gaskets). I was very upset as I just spent all that money and time on it. This is also the time of the year when I need the drysuit the most. 

As there is a repair warranty, I took the suit back to MEC and politely asked for help. The rep at service desk was very pleasant and helpful. And promised to take care of the repair without charge, under warranty and that the suit would be ready in a few days. Later that day, I received a call from a MEC manager to tell me that's not going to happen and accused me of taking advantage of the shop for multiple gaskets repairs and not paying for them. That they do not cover wear and tear. Wear and tear? It was worn 3 times and was torn again! As if it's normal for their service to hold up for 3 wears. Did I mention the drysuit was $1000.00? And the neck gasket can only be repaired/changed 3 times. 

We came to an agreement that they will cover the repair cost but have no idea when it will be repairs as no one at the shop is willing to do it. So my drysuit is currently sitting in the shop without action and I am cancelling all my paddling plans for the next few weeks and a long October vacation trip. The worst part is, everyone who knows about my repair looks at me as if I'm a criminal. I'm the problem, it's my fault all this is happening. REALLY?! WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?",2,0B-8P7HzFB5NeG0PNCGQ9g

After trying to ""put them back together"" we decided that the box was too messy to take the cupcakes in and went back into the store to ask for a different box.

PROS
- 2 dance floors, Main and Hip Hop
- There's a second floor to the Main stage
- Outdoor terrace area with beautiful views of the Vegas strip

CONS
- SUPER crowded. I do not recommend coming here if you are claustrophobic
- They allow smoking in the Main dance floor which is disgusting because people end up flicking their ash on you
- The wait is ridiculous. You have to wait outside and the line wraps around the sidewalk. We waited 2 hours and we were on the guest list (8 girls). A VIP host eventually ended up taking pity on us and brought us into the VIP line.

I'm sure it was expensive too but we didn't have to pay cover since we were an all-girls group. I'll come here again, but not during a peak weekend.

TIP: If you don't care about hanging out in the Main stage area, go up to the outdoor terrace. It's much more chill and you can sit down next to the windows or on the planters.",6,AYGH5HXSHdfOei0y_XdcTg

Our food took 30 mins.. We were the only people on the patio, and I think the only people eating out of the 6 patrons in the resto (4 local/regulars drinking their afternoons away)!So, the server said ""sorry guys not sure what was going on- she should've have checked in with us and let us know right was taking too long and apologized BEFORE delivering it.. We thought she forgot about us!) There was a rotten piece of cabbage in my coleslaw (I just picked it out- the rest of t was fine). Overall, our experience was not terrible, we made the best of it with good company. They need to re-vamp their menu and stop serving what every other pub serves!

Made reservaton for 3 PM Mother's Day, but no need, as Rokerij was not on the collective conscious MD list and thus plenty of open tables. The entertainment lawyer from LA turned waiter 4 months previous seemed quite pleasant and pleased to be in his new role and will only become more refined and astute. Just don't bring up Guns N Roses around him...

(Throughout we were attended to by other friendly staff who seemed to get along well with each other, carrying on light banter within ear shot.)

A gentle reminder to all establishments as we enter the ""warm"" season, please keep a vigilant eye on our water glasses. Sometimes even 30 seconds of ice only at the bottom of a glass can cause mild anxiety.

There were 5 different, occasionally overlapping menus (Rokerji's own lunch, breakfast, dinner; Dick's Hideaway; Richardsons) on the table, as well as colorful chalkboards on the walls full of specials. Choice overload.

We settled into a nice, earthy Firestone cab for me, bellini cocktail for my love, homemade lemonaid for teen daughter, and tea for mother-in-law, followed by calamari and tomato bruschetta for pre meal. All eliciting satisfying, ""Mmmm's!"" from a family not known for the gift of describing presentations and flavors in poetic, food critic terms.

Main courses were blackened Mahi w/ beets and trout w/ green beans (2 separate specials from the board) Pasta Heidi, chicken,beef,shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. we all shared, compared and enjoyed. 3 of the 4 dishes are on the spicey good side.. The trout was purposely tame for wife's mother.

Passed up dessert because someone in the party was jonesing for Costco's strawberry swirl and I was set on buying one of those propane tanks with a gauge (refer to pre-Mother's day grilling malfunction); my reward for pulling off - for the first time in a few years - a successful Mother's Day outing.

Thanks, Rokerij. Hope to see you again soon.",0,BMmqlIKNesbCEav3yqML-A

The environment was slightly upbeat and everyone was having a nice time. It was still relaxed enough that you could do homework there though! The coffee roaster is out in the open in display which is a nice touch.

It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little ""neighborhood gem"" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.  

I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Sol√© Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Mir√≥ Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Sol√© was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.  

HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Sol√©, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience.",4,aHreiNwuRfCi91StteULeA

I find myself coming back over and over to look at house and kitchen stuff I absolutely don't need. Maybe I need new pillows or thank you notes? No? I still need to come look at them because it's Target. Addicting.

This one is closer to my house and it's a relatively nice size. I wouldn't rave about customer service because it's very, very basic or sometimes doesn't exist. On my last visit I had a young lady ringing me up and talking to her friend on the side at the same time. She couldn't scan some soap so she asked me what the price was and I couldn't remember (but I knew it was on sale for two-something dollars). Instead of checking it out, I watched her enter $3.99 as she continued to speak with her friend. I found some other mistakes as well. When I'm out on the floor browsing, I rarely ever get anyone asking if I need any help (if any associates happen to be nearby). 99% of the time I don't actually need help, but it's the thought that counts I guess.

I don't usually grocery shop at Target, but if I do need something then this one is fine for me. It's a good location, parking is easy, carts are always available (with wipes to sanitize!), there's a starbucks in there (umm hello addiction #1), and you can find some good deals. I like how they have easy to find/browse clearance sections at the end of aisles.

We got there about 5:30 and we understand that it was busy. It took our server 20 minutes to bring us margaritas. We asked for flavored margaritas and that was our first mistake. The mango, and strawberry margs tasted like house margaritas and just looked like food coloring has been added. We all ordered salads because we thought how long could those take to be ready? Well, about 40 minutes. I got the wrong salad and it took our server 15 minutes to get to our table to check on us once our food arrived. She was kind enough to take it back, but again, another 30 minutes to bring another salad. Totally unacceptable. Everyone else was finished with their food before I got mine. Also, don't order a side of sour cream, they'll charge you $3!!! 

We will NOT be returning!!! Awful! Oh, and the chicken that was in my salad was not real chicken, I promise it was the bagged breast strips. Ugh!",1,K0knGgjbWeWsBDTVIna0aQ

I am such a regular here that the staff refers to me by first name or with a big excited smile knowing I am back! Actually no not really, but everyone is super polite and it is clean! Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!

So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff. 

The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the ""Fancy Ketchup"" ! I always grab extra ""fancy ketchup"" here to take home with me.

Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep.. 


Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance! 

What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!

My wife and I have dined here several times since it opened as its very close to home and different than anything else in the Lake Wylie area.  We've tried several dishes and they have - hands down - the best spaghetti and meatballs in the Charlotte area.  Definitely better than the chain choices like Maggiano's or Buca Di Beppo.  

We've never had any service issues that other's have complained about.  Service is always speedy and extra polite in nicely pressed clothes and aprons giving an air of sophistication and specialness to every meal.

What the owners have done to the interior of what used to be a Japanese steakhouse is a real testament to wise design choices.  A few booths are tucked into the far side of the restaurant and some nice larger tables in the center, and a few romantic two-tops on the edges.  There is also one large table right at the entrance for large groups.  There is a small bar which has local brews on draft as well as a few stools for those so inclined to prefer bar seating.  The lighting is soft, dark enough for an intimate romantic dinner, but bright enough that a social night out with friends feels open and inviting.  

Sweetwater, Copper, or T-Bones this is not - and that is a nice choice to have in an area inundated with bars and party places which seem to have taken over the Lake Wylie restaurant scene.

There is one caveat to my 5 star review - as some other reviewers have mentioned, the bread served with the entrees is a crunchy, bruschetta style bread served in one or two small slices. Especially with my favorite spaghetti and meatballs dish, this is just not serviceable.  It would be nice if there were other bread choices offered.",2,030KYO7s0Jxu6IWz7Trm-A

Everyone gets a choice of broth for cooking.  And the portion of veggies, noodles and protein is perfect. 

I highly recommend Yojie. The beef was tender and the salmon was fresh. We were totally full but had to have the dark chocolate fondue for dessert. Which was a very good decision.

So the old Papa del's location at the crossing is now closed and has been replaced by a new restaurant on the block! I was surprised to hear about this from my coworker as I have not seen any articles of it in the newspaper or fliers. If you have been to Blaze pizza, it is the same concept; pick your own unlimited toppings and they will cook up a super fresh pizza for you. The staff here are super friendly and greet you as soon as you enter the door. They have 2 types of crust, a normal thicker than thin crust pizza and a gluten friendly dough (read that this is not gluten free as they cannot prevent cross contamination). Next you get to pick from the multiple sauces, I went with the original marinara. They have multiple types of cheeses including fresh mozzarella and provolone! Check out my picture as I cannot type out all of the ingredients, but the highlights would be basil, tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, old world pepperoni, chicken, and meat ball. Once you finish ordering, just hop over to the counter to check out and your set. The pizza comes out pipping fresh, the crust is crisp and can stand on it's own. For 7.99, you get a customized pizza with the toppings you want. Once you goes pie's the limit all of the other fast food pizza locations cannot compare! An added plus is plenty of parking, pre-order with the app and pick up through drive through, and the friendliest staff.

Pros: unlimited toppings for 7.99, friendly service, quick food, fresh ingredients

Cons: It can be a bit overwhelming with all the ingredients, but that's a plus

After eating the crume brulee I obsessed over it for days.The ambience of the resturant on that date created a romanctice mood.

I have also made several trips in between the first and last time. 

However on my very last  visit I took my younger sibling to a breakfast buffet here.  It was disgusting I was T.O at the garbage they were feeding to these little kids.  The plates were dirty,  and everything had a refrigerated taste even the pasties. My heart breaks that any establishment would serve nasty left overs to children.

Needless to say McCormick and Schmicks at least in SouthSide works is now on my do not dine list.",1,V7uS5US4oTf-S9u36HJQCQ

They lure you in with ubiquitous signs of $11.99 for brunch.  But, this is nothing but a fraud.

First, it is $11.99 for brunch, but hey, that doesn't include beverages.  What buffet brunch charges you extra for non-alcoholic beverages?

When you find out that there is an extra charge, it is too late.  You are already seated at the table.  Why? Because your menu makes it clear that there is an extra charge, right there, in bold, in red.  It's just that the 100 or so signs surrounding the hotel offering the $11.99 brunch conveniently don't mention that fact. 

Did I mention the entire buffet line is about 15 feet long? Yes, that's how many options you have in total, about 15.  

Bally's may have once been a decent casino, but it has had to resort to fraud to get customers in.  Truly sad.

For what they offer, $11.99 is not necessarily a good deal either.  I would have rather gone to the Flamingo and paid double for what they offer.",2,76ybvBOPRy0RmFAm8-A7JQ

Just a couple gripes. I don't like the set up here. Once you enter, you think the line is its normal length from the one end of the room to the entrance, just like the other location. Instead, there is no line to place your order. You go straight to the cashier surpassing the long length of people who already paid, but just waiting to be called up for their order to be made. 

I felt stuck, even though I'm sure I could have asked for a refund if I wanted. As opposed to just leaving a line once your impatience bell rings lol. I also didn't like how our 4 separate orders were made in 3 different sections by different people. It was hard to keep up with my kids who each wanted to watch their ice creams being made. 

I like Summerlin's set up where you stand in line and wait to be helped. You place your order with your one guy, and they take care of the whole thing for you, then you pay at the end. Prices are just a little more at this location. There's a loud and pretty obnoxious worker at this location that swore he was a Japanese teppanyaki/hibachi worker. Too boasty but as I watched, he wasted his energy more on his trying to interact and entertain than making the Rolled ice cream to the ""Rolled ice cream"" standard. His rolls kept falling apart.

We gotta show love to Benecio and Shakira though. Benecio went straight into it and perfected my rolls of ice cream. My husband was in disbelief with how good Shakira's rolls were too lol. We'll definitely be back, maybe when it's less busy. I'm hoping they can change their set up to be like Summerlin's.

I wish I had listened sooner as this place is great! No wait and no need for reservations unlike the Cheesecake Factory across the street which had a 2 to 3 hour wait!

Here's how it works:

1. Once seated a server comes and takes your drinks orders and hands each of you a bowl.

2. You go up to first station, the meat station and add as little or as much chicken, steak, pork, shrimp or imitation crab meat as you want. Ignore the ""pick one meat only "" sign. You can get all the meat available if you want. There are also lo mein and rice noodles available at the station 

3. Then you go to the vegetable station and add as much spinach, broccoli, snap peas, onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, tomatoes, carrot and more to your bowl.

4. Next you go to the sauce and seasonings station and pick from over twenty choices.

5. Finally you go over to grill. You will be given a number from 1 to 10. The number you get is were you go and place your bowl and sauce(s) and wait while your food is cooked. Be sure to tip the cooks. They will give you a cheer when you do.

6. And last but not least sit and enjoy. 

Once you have your food your server will offer you white or brown rice, lettuce wraps or tortillas to go with your meal.

One bowl cost $8.99 for adults and $6.49 for kids 3 to 11, but unlimited bowls for adults are just $2 more and the second kids bowl is free. Even if you're full off the first bowl go through again and take it home for lunch the next day.

Our server Luke was great. He explained to us how everything worked. We each started off with a tasty Raspberry Lemon Aid.

For my first bowl I had lo mein, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. The cooks were really nice and talked to each person while they cooked there food. They teased us about it being our first time there.
Let me tell you, the food was delicious! Everything was fresh and tasted so good!

For my second bowl I had lo mein, chicken, shrimp, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. It was just as good as the first. I could only eat about a quarter of it and took the rest for lunch the next day.

They also offer appetizers and desserts and have a full bar.

Reviews for Barbarians seemed good so I made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday 3 weeks in advance. We showed up at exactly 8:30 with about 3 other couples arriving within 2 minutes of us. We were all told there was about a five minute wait and they gave us some bubbly wine to compensate. BF and I thought that was a nice touch since 5 minutes was not a long wait. 30 minutes later, one pair of couples were seated while the line up at the door continued to grow and we were anxiously, hungrily waiting for our table. The other two waiting couples were seated before us and then around 9:10 we were finally brought to our table by the manager who said ""I will take care of you to ensure a special evening"". We were brought to the worst table in the whole restaurant right in front of the kitchen where you can see and hear everything. We saw another table being cleared and asked to move. The waiter gave us attitude but allowed the change. Once seated we waited another 10 minutes for menus, water, bread and dill veggies. I was driving so I chose not to drink (also high wine prices). BF ordered a vodka (not premium) which we found out cost $13.00. We ordered our meal (shared ceaser salad, filet mignon & NY Sirloin. The salad came out on two plates but we were not offered some fresh pepper. It had a decent taste but was nothing special. About 10 minutes later the food came out (a bit quick for my liking being at a ""fancy"" steakhouse). Bf's steak tasted completely burnt with no flavor so we asked to send it back. Their excuse ""it's charred"". Our response, it's burnt. My steak was over cooked and had zero flavors. Disappointing. Tried to wait to eat with BF when his steak came out but it was taking twenty minutes. The baked potatoes (I asked if I could switch to mashed and was told ""no substitution) were cold and drenched in toppings. We asked for a bit of bacon and the cheese to add flavor but there was more of the toppings than there was potato. The second steak received was not much better than the first. Not once did anyone come to ask how the food was or if it was better. Halfway through the eating of the steaks I realized our water had also not been filled in at least 15 minutes. I kept trying to get a waiters attention but kept getting ignored to the point where I went to the bar to get my own water. We were so disappointed. I had also called the day before to remind them it is for a birthday for the gentleman I will be with. They did bring a ""cake"" at the end which ended up being the apple beignets. They basically throw it on the table and mutter happy birthday. They also gave it to me instead of my boyfriend even after clear instructions. The dessert was also disappointing as it was not a donut but an apple shaped as a donut with way too much cinnamon. The bill arrived without being asked if we wanted tea or coffee or anything else. I noticed that the steak was not removed from the bill which would have been a nice touch. Everything, including the dessert was charged which I was upset about especially after our horrible experience. The manager never came to see us or ask how the meal or evening was even though we noticed him schmoozing with other guests. We were certainly not ""taken care of"" as earlier told. At this point I decided to tell the manager about our experience. I started with ""I will be paying for this meal but this is what happened and why we had a negative experience"" and before he even let me continue he took the bill, said don't pay, don't come back and please leave. What terrible customer service. Not only will I never go back but I will make sure no one I know or ever speak to goes there either. The birthday meal was completely ruined. Other than the pickles we were utterly disappointed and have nothing positive to remember from Barberian's. For the price you are better off going to the Keg (less money, better service and way better food) or spending more and going to one of the nicer steakhouses like Ruth Chris, Morton's or Jacobs.

There is no line, just a massive swarm of bees around the queen (read: door guy.) Loitering about without knowing what to do or where to stand will get you nowhere real quick. You'll be trapped in the non-queue without any tangible progress seeing how...you know... there's no line and all.

The easiest way is to just shove your way to front. Don't politely wait for someone to let you through, put up your elbows and clear a path. This works! Sure you get some dirty looks and disgruntled grumbles here and there, but at least you're not that chump being shoved around! We were on the guestlist, but the 8 boys that showed up with us were not. We then opted for table service which ensured a private enclave separate from the crowded dance floor and a guaranteed place to sit throughout the evening. This definitely made a difference and attributed to the favorable review.

The AC works fine, drinks were reasonably priced for a Vegas club. Lady Gaga showed up for a performance which was amazing, and we stayed until the lights came on @ 4am.

They have free WiFi and a color printer that you can use (for a small per page fee). Their patio is great to sit on in the warm weather and you can take your food to-go. They also have a corner with some toys and books for kids!

My only issues with this place is the limited seating and that they're not open on Sunday! If you're going during a busy time of day (weekend brunch, for example) don't expect to find a place to sit.

I went in with very high expectations knowing that Lee was named one of the ""Ten Chefs of the Millenium"", and was not at all disappointed.  The meal at Lee Restaurant was the best I had in Toronto, far exceeding the likes of Mistura, Scaramouche and the ever-so-popular Guu.

My GF and I ordered four dishes and two desserts, of which I strongly recommend the Singaporean slaw.  If there is one thing you should get, order the slaw.  We ordered it plain, without the sashimi, but I could definitely see how the fish could add an additional dimension to the already perfect salad -- something I'm looking forward to trying in the near future.  The salad honestly tasted better after each and every bite, so I would suggest ordering at least one salad for every two persons in the party.

We also ordered the black cod, but I went a little overzealous with the lime juice and made it slightly too sour.  The turnip cake underneath was a delight.

The top chef curry chicken was probably my second favourite dish of the night.  The strong S.E.A. influence completely took me by surprise, and I absolutely loved it.

The last thing that came was a special duck dish that was not on the menu: chashu duck (basically peking duck with a twist).  The dish came with some bbq'd duck pieces, a foie gras mousse spread, crispy tofu skins, various traditional peking duck condiments and pancake wraps.  The tofu skin provided the crunchy texture that replaces the duck skin of peking duck (to my understanding) which I thought was genius.  It was a fun and engaging dish, but I would probably not order it again.

We ordered a banana cake (meh) and a ""French Tong Yuen"" dish for dessert.  ""Tong yuen"" is a traditional Chinese dessert dumpling made with sesame paste wrap inside glutenous rice flour.  This one was essentially that, but with chocolate ganache, peanuts, sesame and a few other things instead.  Amazing.

The overall dining experience was great.  We called at about 9 PM on a Thurs. night, and got a reservation at 9:30.  Our waiter was attentive, and very knowledgeable of the dishes and gave us well appreciated recommendations.  The ambiance was lively, and the decor was very unique.

My guest ordered a margarita ($12) which came in a small glass that was half filled with ice. A bit chintzy for the place. I ordered a Sangria that was bigger but came in a plastic cup. Unacceptable.

We would have ordered a pitcher of margaritas or sangria but for the prices. The margarita pitcher is $50 and the sangria is right behind at 
$40. I may be wrong on those prices but if I am it is because I've got them too low, not too high. Feel free to correct me. Either way it's too much.

We shared the mango salad. It was fine but not what we anticipated. That's okay - we should all have our expectations challenged on occasion.

The so-called co-owner needs to go to anger management classes because if you question him on work performed, he turns into a raving lunatic.
I bring my car in for repair all nice and sweet.  I question the work that was done and like a JEKYLL AND HYDE.   
I know they did things on my car that DID NOT NEED to be done because they were just done.  Besides that they totally ripped me off...labor....ridiculous...warranty they give IS A JOKE...Tells me that they never should of let me take withe car with brakes less than 50%...it's a law...I HAVE THE PROOF THAT THEY PUT ON NEW PADS BEFORE I GOT IT.  
RIPPING PEOPLE OFF IS A CRIME.......

Long story short I ordered to-go and requested the order be done 20 minutes in the future. This caused a big fuss at the restaurant, no one was able to ring me up. They had to call two managers...etc. So the next to-go I asked for the order to be ready ''as soon as possible.'' The computer tells you to pick the food up in 15 minutes. 

When I got to the restaurant Jesus says to me ''Your to-go order is almost ready!'' Great, I said, and sat down. A few minutes later I hear Jesus saying to the cooks ''You didn't make that to-go order?'' He then came around to me and asked me if I placed the order to be ready at 4:36 (this was noon'ish). I said no, I had placed the order to be ready as soon as possible. And I explained what happened before. Needless to say they didn't have my order.

Soon, Athena appears and makes things much worse, basically calling me a liar, and saying that my waiting wasn't a problem. I don't make to-go orders so I can sit in the restaurant another 20 minutes. If Athena KNEW anything about this restaurant, she would know there is a drop down box when you order, with 10 minute increments. It's literally impossible for me to have placed this order to be ready at 4:36. But I still got the blame. 

I wrote corporate to tell them what a sucky employee they have. She basically has no idea of her job, and turns around and blames customers. I think I see why so many Applebee's are closing all over the place. I can spend $30 on lunch and be insulted elsewhere, thanks.",3,XNzChtoNOw706kps82x0Kg

I had expressed to him that I did not want to use proactive as my skin care (full of chemicals and potentially create wrinkles,etc); however, he insisted that proactive is a good skincare. For my acne treatment, he prescribed me 2 creamers and pills to take (probably full of chemicals which defeats the purpose of me quitting the use of proactive). 

He didn't fully examine my face. He didn't take a good look at my skin. He didn't ask me what my daily routine is. What my diet is. He just came in and was basically like ""so I hear you are having problems with your acne. Here is what I can prescribe you with."" Done. 

He at least told me that my insurance is good so it should cover for the prescriptions. Great! 
Although I was not convinced and was not fully satisfied, I was still content during my first visit here until this happened..

She told me that she sent the prescriptions to Walgreens and that they should give me a call once they're done and THATS when the real problem happened. I never received a call. 

So I called the nearest Walgreens (I didn't even know the exact location bc she didn't tell me) 2 hrs later and they told me that they don't have any prescriptions sent under my name. 

I called the doctors office but the nurses were on a lunch break. I left a message and asked to call back.. they never called back so I called again that day. The nurses were busy. 

Day 2, I called again and the nurses were busy again so I left a message and they told me they would call me back ASAP. That never happened. 

But the specialized pharmacy gave me a call telling me that they have few of my prescriptions but they're not covered by my insurance.... another thing to ask my dermatologist about..

Day 3, I called and they were busy again! So I told them my situation and they said they will email the manager so she can be the one to reach me back. That, of course, never happened so I finally asked when is the best time to call because every time I had called, the nurses were always ""busy"". They told me to call the next day at any time because there is no clients. 

Day 4, I called and asked to talk to the nurse. What did I expect.. they replied back with their usual ""I'm sorry.. the nurses are busy at the moment. Would you like to leave your message so that we can contact you later?"" NO! 

Been calling many times. Never got the call back. Even when I asked for the right time to call, they were always ""busy""

When they realized I was now upset, the nurse FINALLY talked to me. 

For my problem # 1 (walgreens never received the prescriptions and I have no idea which location the ""closest Walgreens"" was) She told me the exact location she sent the prescription to and told me they should have it by now. 

For my problem #2 (my prescriptions were not covered by my insurance), she told me about the replacement she could go ahead and prescribe for me where I can pick it up at the same Walgreens but for the other one, she would have to ask the doctor and that she will give us a call back... of course I never received a call back from them and the replacement prescriptions she sent was ALSO not covered by my insurance and in fact, it was three times more expensive than the original one!! 

After waiting 3 days for them to give me a call back,  I gave up and bought the original one the doctor had prescribed. Yes they were expensive as they were not covered by my insurance but I thought it would be worth it if it could fix my bad acne break out. 

It's been almost a month now and it has actually made my face a lot worse. The stuff he told me to put on my face just really irritated the skin to a point it hurts to even apply water on my face. 

The side effect was really bad so I couldn't apply it on my face that often. & this is where I go back about the doctor not listening to me at all. I told him that I want to avoid chemicals because I have sensitive skin. & he still prescribed me something that potentially is melting my skin off from my face. Once again, he didn't even carefully look at my face or ask about my daily routine.. so that kind of explains the outcome.. 

And the pill.. it makes me so nauseous even after consuming it with food that I've thrown up couple times from taking this pill. I don't think any of these are working and I'm not planning on going back there either. They're just so unprofessional and really unorganized! I feel like the co pay of $80 and the prescribed meds/ointments that costed me around $200 was such a waste!!! 

They were all really nice, I can give them a star for that. But I did not appreciate how they didn't seem to ""care"" about me. If I could have my money back, it would be greatly appreciated. If I could have my skin back, it would be even better. I will definitely be looking for somewhere else where they can give me a better service and provide me the right treatment for MY face and not for ""another client with acne"".",2,PY0UMc96SIToqJ9X1WPyoA

We ordered taste of spread(4 of them), calamari fritti for appetizers. Sea scallops and striped bass for main dishes. Everything was good until the first appetizer, spread was served. Then the server told us that the sea scallops ran out of so we had to order something else. Okay, we changed the order to slow braised lamb shank. In about 20mins, the server came again and told us striped bass ran out of as well. 

What? Either the server didn't order it so we missed the last dish or the kitchen staffs don't know what they are doing. We just let it go. Then he served lamb shank before they even serve the calamari! We asked about calamari and he said it was ready. Then another 20mins passed. We already lost our appetite! 

Even though there was a manager walking around but he didn't seem to know what is going on. There is a big management problem with this restaurant. I checked the other reviews and they also mentioned about bad service and management.

The food? The spread was okay like the most of greek restaurants. The lamb was under my expectation. It was not as tender as I expected. (Trying to be fair for food review despite of bad service) 

I think their food is average and maybe some of dishes can be more than that. If you are lucky, you don't experience this worst service and can enjoy your food. Otherwise, you only get served two dishes other than four dishes you ordered.

unfortunately...things didn't pan out so well.  I've been to the Hard Rock and like the vibe of the casino floor, the music, the memorabilia, and the decided to try the hotel and its amenities.  
the first thing that didn't go as planned was the fact that we couldn't get the King Size bed we reserved for the first night and so they put us in the double Queen.  I couldn't sleep the first night at all!  the beds felt like college futons - small, too soft, and uncomfortable!  I pushed with the front desk and was able to switch which isn't great mid stay.  But the King was way better!
The hotel and casino is huge! we must have walked over 10k steps each day just trying to get around to eat, casino, and pools.  Also, the layout was so disorienting we got lost a couple of times.  Didn't help when we drank - LOL.  
the food and drinks were pretty on the high side and it was unfortunate that some drink and food coupons were not given until the 2nd day there...why? i have no idea.
The pools were pretty nice...very loungey and helped to cool off the 100degree weather we got in August.  
Overall...it was ok.  I always do enjoy the music they play all over the hotel and the music videos constantly playing as well.

After 3 years of sun and rain, Dirty Harry (who I never owned in pristine condition as it is) was hanging on by a thread.  I searched Yelp for bike repair near my work and found Old Town Beach Cruisers.  I called 'em up and they stayed open late on a Friday eve for me to bring him by and asses the damage, was he salvageable?

You betcha: 2 tire tubes, basket wire bending, a chain, some oil, and some new rubber handle grips later... he was back in working-wicked-fast-order, rusted out fenders still included (so vintage).  This bike just does not know when to quit, that's all that needed replacing after years of neglect?  The nice(r) part was they didn't try to upsell me, were very friendly, and had everything done and ready to go by 10 am the next morning.  They even called to let me know he was ready to roll.

I haven't even been there for several months because I didn't think their therapy machines were helping me more than things I could do at home when I don't feel well.

As for the experience when I did go regularly I would give it about 3/5 stars. Half of the personnel were nice and half super cranky.

i actually had avoided going back since then because usually when i brunch i go the omelette route but.. . .

i went back recently for a friend's birthday, however, and tried the combo plate.  i liked that this option existed since it was just 1 egg (cooked however you want it), 1 sausage patty (or whatever meat option) and 3 buttermilk pancakes.  it was like i got to have all the different foods but in smaller portions so that i could actually eat it all.

a friend got potato pancakes with his eggs benedict which looked awesome!   i'm not sure how you can go wrong with thin fried crispy slivers of mashed potatoes though.  the eggs benedict themselves actually didn't look that great and honestly made me just yearn for the amazing eggs benedict at cafe continental.

Good things come to those who wait -- our experience was fabulous.  The restaurant was not too crowded on a weeknight, so we were seated in the more casual downstairs venue.  It still felt like a nice night out.

My husband ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi and gave me a taste.  It had a very nice taste and texture that was brightened by the orange in the mascarpone crema. I ordered the Diver Scallops and was not disappointed! The kohlrabi slaw provided a nice counterbalance to the creamy scallops and the house siracha gave a nice punctuation to the plate without being overly spicy.

There were two cool teachers. That's it. Save your money and go to Aveda. They work with you until you get it right. You're paying 20k which is a thousand more than Avalon but for the learning and experience I'm more than willing. They actually have state board training during the final phase and master series (classes) from barbers to color and cut specialists and so much more from Hattori Hanzo and the Aveda Network. Even people who have just heard about Aveda products want to come in and see what we're about from all over the the country.

1. The Rivertowne's wings are fabulous. The wing special on Wednesday night is not to be missed: WHOLE buffalo wings for 75 cents each. The wings are fresh, and huge -- and definitely aren't those cheesy little drumsticks or flats you pay way too much for at other places. 

2. Check their website for their several 'happy hours' with discounts on booze, but more importantly, with half-price appetizers that are HUGE and delicious.  The Bacon-Cheddar Ranch fries is a huge plate of fries covered with REAL cheese and REAL bacon. Yeah, your arteries will scream with every bite, but at least you'll die happy. 

3. I haven't eaten anything here that wasn't delicious. I travel quite a bit and have suffered through some unfortunate restaurants  -- but the Rivertowne isn't one of these unfortunates. 

4. I even have brought my nephews and nieces here -- this place is definitely a family-friendly place. The waitstaff are super and accommodating.

The first time I went in to this place I was blown away , this place is amazing , you can get lost in all the equipment that they have. I was in there looking for a new set of irons. Now it's been bout two years since the last time I played so I was a bit intimidated bout asking for help. I older gentmen came up to me and ask how he can help me. I told him my situation and he was very helpful answered all. My questions and showed me different sets that I might like. Then he let me hit a few with each set and made sure I was happy with the one I decided on. He was very helpful and made me feel excited to play the game again..

So a few days later I decided to come back and buy a new driver and fairway woods just to complete my set. I'm not sure why but I receive the worst customer service I have ever gotten. I was treated like I didn't belong in that store. I was ignored my all of the employees. The gentlemen that helped me the first time was not there so I couldn't go back to him. So I decided to man up and ask for help. I had to flag someone down and when I finally got someones attention , that attitude the employee gave me was atrocious. He made me feel like I was wasting his time.  I told what I was looking for and the answer I got was shocking. When I told him I was looking for a new driver and woods the employee rolled his eyes then just point and the drivers and woods. "" that's a driver , that a driver and those over there are your woods"" then walked away. I was very offended by this. 

I feel like if I went in wearing the same attire ( collar shirt , dress pants and shoes) I would of gotten the same service as the first time a came in to the store.

I usually get something simple like a whiskey and coke which for 2 for 1 is 2 for $3.50 which you can't find anywhere besides maybe Fremont Street for even one for $3.50.

The problem is the little hot French spinner had a curfew.  She had promised me a great time.  We were late for curfew when we left the Restraunt.  Thanks a lot.  She got back with her boyfriend of 4 years the next week.  I could have been her mistake.,0,NRI3xGPdsfjpjcy6JCbELQ

Small and quaint, we were seated in the indoor dining room and quickly greeted by the waiter/owner. We took a while to order, but this was due to everything on the menu looking so appetizing. In addition, they have a huge wine list, sure to please a connoisseur, with about 150 different bottles.

After we ordered, we were brought very warm bread with olive oil and vinegar for dipping. The oil was great with the black pepper, red pepper, and spices.

We ordered the Insalata Gorgonzola with one of our entrees; the dressing was light, the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar went well with the Gorgonzola, and the fresh diced tomatoes made this a fantastic salad.

We had the Puttanesca and the Lamb Ciociara. The Puttanesca was outstanding. The sauce was deep, a little earthy, and the pasta was packed with olives, onions, capers, and most importantly, flavor!

My order of the lamb came out with the side of angel-hair pasta. The sauce on this lamb entree was outstanding. If we could have bought jars of the stuff we would have. The flavors of the pesto and fresh tomatoes complemented the fullness of the lamb, and the onions added a little sweetness to this savory dish. I did however find the lamb to be a little too grizzly for my liking. Although it was boneless and trimmed a little, I don't enjoy having to dig around the fat and grizzle to get to the best part. The staff here is so accommodating and so superb that I was able to switch out my dish for the Pescatora Sud Risotto (southern risotto): best decision possible.

Shortly after asking for the risotto, John brought it to our table, and this risotto was the highlight of the trip. I asked for it to be prepared spicy, and the spice was not overwhelming where it masked the rest of the entree, but it was enough to remind you that you did in fact request a spicy dish. The mussels were creamy, shrimp was flavorful, rice was cooked right, and the plate did not have a fishy smell or aftertaste. The risotto itself wasn't super creamy or heavy, but it still was loaded with flavor and the portion size was big enough to fill you up. Packed with a great assortment of seafood (clams, mussels, calamari, etc), this is definitely an entree to have again.

Eating at an Italian restaurant requires us to try their homemade Tiramisu, and this was no exception. The description didn't lie; layered with a light marscapone cream made this Tiramisu one of the lightest we've had. It didn't have a lot of espresso or alcohol flavor, but the portion size was enough to share, and the airiness didn't make you feel like you ate an overwhelming dessert. Recommended for sure!

We will definitely be back as this is one of our top choices for a family-owned Italian restaurant. John knows his food and his wine, his wife sure knows how to create spectacular meals, and they both know how to treat their customers",6,XX3jVXBmXYvUIQSw0YPoCg

My wonderful friend Kristin (who is a spa connoisseur) insisted that I join her for a day at the spa during our recent stay at the Encore. I figured, ""eh, it's only $30 and we're at one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever seen. What the heck?"" What a fantastic decision that turned out to be! I'll admit that I'm easily impressed (""oh boy, recent issues of Cosmo AND Vanity Fair for my reading pleasure?!"") but seriously, this place was great. Here's what I enjoyed during my...uhhh...5 hours at the spa:

- very nice staff, including a receptionist/host who gave me a tour of the facilities 
- the infamous silky, yet still plush, Encore bath robe 
- 2 hot tubs of varying temperatures, seating WITHIN the tubs
- 2 cool pool / dipping baths
- waterfall showers!
- a 12-showerhead shower
- heated marble-mosaic lounge chairs (omg omg omg)
- steam room
- awesome sauna
- all the cucumber- or orange-infused ice water I could drink, a fine selection of teas, and some sort of gently-spiced mixed nut snack. (Like I said, easily impressed).
- ""Tranquility Lounge"" with luxe chaise lounges
- unreal decor - drapes made of Swarovski crystal, large stone planters/vases, beautiful colors/fabrics/textures all over the place

I have never felt so relaxed and fresh as I did that day! And I can't believe it was only $30 - I think that even included access to the fitness center, but I was too busy enjoying the jacuzzis to do anything related to exercise.

IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,1,2014-08-19 23:10:56,1,eigKhUsrgtglY3k6EGFQfg,"Went here for dinner based on the reviews and overall I found that the food was very good, but it is really overpriced.  I noticed numerous other reviews say the same about the prices.  One lady I saw said she did NOT think it was overpriced, and quoted that she paid $35 for 1 entr√©e and 1 appetizer at lunch.  You don't think $35 for a lunch with appetizer is overpriced?  Man, I wish I could live in that world.

The stuff we had was typical ""high end"" fare...exotic sounding ingredients in small, well presented portions.  For 2 people for dinner, we had 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 1 entr√©e, and 1 dessert...no wine/drinks of any sort and the bill was $100 flat including tax without tip.  The prices need to come down about 20% in my opinion, although I could live with 15%.  As it stands, we really enjoyed the food but it isn't the kind of place we will justify going back to any time soon.  I like great food and I have no issues spending big money on great food, but it is just too overpriced, even for an overpriced haute cuisine type place.

The grilled octopus appetizer was very good.  A nice char with a good blend of flavors from the romescu, potato and avocado, but at $16, it was about $4 too much.

The prawn appetizer was tasty, although they were overcooked.  Also, 4 large prawns in a flavored broth is a bit much at $15.  

The free range chicken breast entr√©e was very good as well.  It came with a little portion of their tasty mac and cheese, with chile and white cheese (cheddar I believe).  Cripsy on the outside and pretty juicy inside.  Very good, but again, at $23 for 1 large breast and some mac and cheese, it is about $4 too much.

My wife had a nice little peach salad, which was good, especially since peaches are in season.  It consisted of 1 peach, halved, then topped with some kind of cheese and nuts and some other items.  Not exactly a massive serving, and if I remember correctly it was $14 or $16.  1 peach...cut. in. half.  Come on.

The one thing that I felt was pretty fairly priced was the dessert.  I had a peach pie, which came with a nice scoop of ice cream, and it was a pretty decent sized serving, and for $9, it was pretty on point I felt.

Also, they have a delicious little bread basket which is on the house and they even refilled it, so obviously I appreciate that there are other house costs like the free bread that have to be covered, but at these prices you better eat a few baskets.  Not hard to do mind you, especially with the tasty little mix of butter, salt, honey and olive oil they provide.

Overall, the food was great and we had no issues with the service as some others have described.  However, at $100 pre tip with only house water to drink and $118 with tip for 2 people and only ONE entr√©e and 1 dessert, it was just WAY too much.  $85 pre tip would be acceptable, $75-80 would be better.  Would I return?  Sure...but not anytime soon and probably only on rare occasions.  For that kind of money, they are other places I enjoy and other places I want to try, so I just can't justify working into any kind of regular rotation.",1,8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ

My husband ordered the French toast brioche and because there has been some confusion in the past, we went so far as to make air circles to confirm with the waiter which French toast we wanted. (It's the round one.) After waiting way too long for our food, the waiter brought the other French toast because he ""was confused.""  If you're confused about what a customer wanted, would it dawn on you maybe to ask or clarify?  My husband then had to wait to get his meal.

There are several pools, each with a different feeling.  Two of the pools have bar & food service.  The main pool is bi-level with a waterfall in the middle, and a HUGE hot-tub next to it.

I moved here from Northern California last year for school and I was in desperate need of quality ice cream. If you know Northern California, there are quality creameries everywhere and I needed something here in Arizona.

This place is a local, small business, that produces top quality ice cream. I think they make all the ice cream at the main store on Shea and then deliver it to their store on 16th and the one at the airport. They are rated in multiple national rankings of ice cream and I can't get enough. 

Their flavors rotate around so you never know what you're going to get when you walk in so I recommend going there. A LOT. They do a lot of seasonal flavors too so some of the flavors are only available for a month or so. Also, all of their toppings like the fudge and whip cream are made in store. 

Some of my favorite flavors: Horchata, Brownie Swirl, Jameson Irish Cream, Cherry Yuzu Cream Cheese, Peaberry Espresso, Madagascar Vanilla, Milk and Cookies, Salted Butter Caramel, Brown Butter Pecan, Huckleberry, Mayan Chocolate, Fleur de Sel Caramel, and Pumpkin Spice.

Venus 21 is tucked in an East Charlotte shopping center (Intersection of Village Lake Dr. and Indepedence Blvd.) where Lebo's and K & W is located.  They do women, men, and children.  And I believe they have tanning.

I have not recieved a hair cut this precise ever; they use scissors and a razor to ensure that you don't have random hairs sticking out, shaving your neckline with a razor (the entire perimeter, not just the back) and spend way more time that Great Clips or even Sports Clips.  

The only drawback is that most of the barbers speak Spanish.  The owner is a New York Dominican and if he doesn't cut your hair, he will make sure that the other barbers understand how you want it cut.  It is a veritable melting pot-Latins, African-Americans, and a few whites.  I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be served.  

If you don't mind the banter in Spanish between the barbers, I promise you that will you get a good haircut.",5,7IZQ06zkYSCLQM4JU9kFvg

Got there around 6:00pm and although the place had empty tables we had to wait to be seated. My son has eaten here before and raves over the food so we thought an excellent choice for dinner. Now, the first reviewer on Yelp really raves over the service and warm staff, but I found neither to be true. They barely acknowledged us ---the chips were terribly stale and salsa bland. 
   Now , we placed our orders and we waited 45 minutes for the food to come---I had asked our server if something was wrong as it was 7:00pm and still no food. She said one of their cooks was not there that night and they were a bit behind. No dear, you were way behind ---when the food came out all the rice and bean sides were stone cold but the entrees were at least hot. We informed her of this and they brought out all  new (and hot) rice and bean. At no time did the server ask to refill my husband's ice tea ---that is just poor service. I do think the food is very good and high quality but the service and professionalism is sorely lacking. There have been at least four different restaurants located at this site--maybe some of you remember Glorious Cuisine from the late 80's , then Rao's and another Mexican place which did not make it. I would at least try the place one more time just to see if the service gets any better because the food is well prepared and good---just indifferent on the service.",1,me_DfeOZUFZB7pTlXv-Aag

I have never eaten sushi at Sushi Boat.  Nor would I.  Leaving aside  the fact that I'm now a vegetarian, were I to desire the relatively risky consumption of uncooked sea creatures, I would want to partake in an ultra-clean, temperature-controlled restaurant devoted to serving raw fish to patrons.  And I don't mind paying a lot for it, either, so long as they can deliver on taste and safety.

Sushi Boat is a cramped, not exactly pristine place that always seems too hot and is designed to quickly produce food for hungry, anxious undergrads.  So I might avoid their raw fish, but I am all about their other food.

What's to love?

-The menu is great.  You pick a starch (rice, noodles), a protein (tofu, various meats and seafoods), a style (soup, rice bowl, noodle bowl), and a flavor (Szechuan, Hunan, Thai, etc.).  Very simple, designed for speed, and well thought out.
-Great for vegetarians, and they'll work with you on things like steaming vs. frying the tofu.
-Cheap soups and appetizers.
-The quantity is right on.
-There's seating upstairs for dining in.
-A nice selection of canned/bottled drinks.
-The register guy is very professional and friendly, which I can't say about some other restaurants in Oakland.

What's not to love?

-The seating area is kinda dirty and unattended.  They can do better for probably very low cost.
-They don't use sustainable to-go containers.  That's a problem all over PGH.

If you're looking for a fast, relatively healthy lunch, this is a great place.",2,a4QpolOARTEhgAyC79bK9A

I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...

Entry:
I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. 

Environment:
Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. 

Food/Drink:
Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. 

One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. 

EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",4,qhqYQ0vbhjBFZN4fU93M9Q

I'm pretty into ramen and try to find various takes when traveling or at home. This was my first trip to Ki Ramen and I ordered the Shoyu ramen, feeling chicken broth would cure this crazy spring weather. The broth is tasty--good flavors. Ramen noddles itself are fine, a bit harder than I like and a bit bland. As for the toppings, the cabbage could have been softened and the onsen egg was a little too soft for my taste. (It's softer than a soft-boiled egg.) There are some spice and flavor seasoning on the table (chilli pepper, black peppercorn, and MSG), but nothing that is real heat. I suspect that the red heat that I'm accustomed to with ramen is an extra topping option that I saw on the menu for $1.

Soon as we sat down, they served us a platter full of wide selection of breads with the butter with Black British Sea Salt . It was so delicious .

Updated top flavor list:

1. Pecan - superbly roasted pecans in a milky, creamy paleta; this is the best one; we get it every time, in addition to trying new flavors
2. Pineapple - fresh, explosive flavor with real chunks of pineapple
3. Banana - fresh, sweet flavor with real chunks of banana; 
4. Pineapple Chili - Like pineapple, but sweeter and with a slight hint of pepper
5. Lemon Drop - extremely tart, with sugar on the outside; not for everyone, but great if you like a sour snack
6. Rice Pudding - the cinnamon is strong, so good if that is your flavor

For anything else, I'd have to go with 3. Despite having one of the best beer selections in town, I don't think I'd hang out here all night - just not comfy enough. Lots of tables, cramped, bar is super open, noisy, kids everywhere, eh. Everything we had other than pie was so-so as well - Pasta special (primavera penne) was very standard. Jalapeno poppers (I know I know) were all breading, no spice, and filled with velveeta. For 7 bucks, at a good pizza joint, I expected more. I also found it surprising how little garlic adorned our order of 8 garlic knots. Tasted like we were eating dinner rolls.

But the pizza was goooood. Not a crust style I've ever been in love with in the past, but can come to love, I think - sweet, whole wheat-y, soft. For me, this means I'll be getting gorgonzola on every pizza I order to contrast the sweetness of the crust, but that's fine. Toppings are interesting, nothing over the top (buffalo mozz and truffle oil not to be seen, for example) but they've got some twists - eggplant puree, chorizo, whole cloves of roasted garlic.

Recently just last week Sporting Life had their grand opening and that literalli put the life back onto this mall. The Hudsons Bay recently just got a major renovation too, its now more modern and carries all the lines the Yorkdale location does.

They've also inserted an H&M and Sephora in there as well. I'm pretty upset still that they closed the boathouse outlet.

The only downfall to this mall is the food court reeks balls. It has very limited seating. Now they have expanded and brought some higher end stores they HAVE to update the food court, this one just isn't going to cut it.

Hanoi is a perfect example of a differentiated top performer.  Their soup was very pleasant and flavourful yet light and not too salty, and they use a more transparent noodle version which is different to the typical pho places.  It was a very pleasant light meal.  

Only thing is they come in 1 size only, so you can't pick an XL for the starving boys.

Also, I wasn't as impressed with the sides I ordered...when I go to a restaurant and order mussels i would be expecting fresh muscles, not those big one shell packaged mussels.  (even though I have to admit it was cooked in a nice way)

I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.

Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.

Overall I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars, it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back in the future.",2,cRDQuBEgxaYQoSPHAiEgHQ

When I arrived I again mentioned the tire rotation. They took the car in and 25 minutes later I'm presented with the car and the invoice. I again ask if the tires were rotated. Mike G says yes. I pay the bill and before I drive away I get a text regarding doing a survey on my experience at Greulich. It wasn't until later that evening that I'm filing the invoice and some other bills that I even look at what they did. Nowhere does it mention a tire rotation. Three pages of an invoice and the word tire doesn't appear anywhere. Only the oil & filter work and charges. Even if they do a complimentary tire rotation it should state they did one. Plus it gives them the opportunity to tell the customer if the brake pads are worn or need to be replaced soon etc. Nothing. Not a word about tires. Not even we checked the air pressure for you. Fast service but I get the feeling I only got half of what I asked for THREE times!,0,0GdcquNApLjkjpqDa8RQvw

Absolutely loved it!  The service was amazing, the staff were hilarious, and trust me, in a place this busy, you need to have a sense of humour.

We were seated at a small rail of a table at the end of the bar, facing the street.  Since we were right next to the bar, it was really crowded, but not to worry, our server moved us to a primo table on the patio as soon as it became available.

We had a couple of drinks and some food.  I ordered a pear cider and it was delicious, my friend ordered a beer.  She let me try it and it tasted like basil and citrus, really good!  I ordered fish and chips and she ordered duck mac & cheese.  I was disappointed with my order because the fish was salmon - who would bread and deep fry a piece of salmon?  It was gross, but you know what? I inhaled it because I was starving.  Besides, the patio table, the delicious cider, and the smores beer I washed everything down with more than made up for it.

Started with the Thai iced tea to cool us down. Freaking delicious. Iced tea topped with evaporated and coconut milk mixed in. We got down to ordering:
chicken skewers with peanut satay sauce - decent.
tom yum goong - everything you want your tom yum to be.
pineapple fried rice - too oily, had no pineapple, tasted like fried rice.
green curry eggplant - tasty
red curry chicken - very bold flavors and we finished this one quick

overall the portions were very generous. The sauces were delicious, made in house and the highlights of the meal. The food itself was a bit bland, undercooked and off. Most of it relied heavily on sauces.

The Contemporary Exhibits are downright absurd.

We worked things out and got it back in working order. 6 months later, same problem. They resurface again, no charge, the pads are fine. 6 months later the vibration is back again. I make an appointment, show up, and am told it should be about 4 hours. I opt to stay nearby, and walk down the street for coffee while I wait for their call. Nearly 4 hours later I get a call from service. Not saying it's ready, but saying they've just gotten to it and that the vibration isn't really that bad, trying to play it off. I say I want it fixed (at this point my warranty is nearly up, why would I leave a problem untreated until it costs more to fix or eats more brake pads?). The service writer says the technician doesn't recommend resurfacing a 3rd time. Duh! That's completely unsafe. They have to call back after running it past the manager, and they agree to replace the rotors finally. Total time waited was well over 6 hours. I'm pleased that things finally got resolved, and I've had zero issues with the new parts. What really was unacceptable was 1) trying to downplay the issue while being part of the reason it existed, 2) trying to brush me off by stating the obvious like I'm an idiot and would just go away, and 3) the real cherry on top,
the service writer said loudly as I was paying to make sure the customer good will paperwork was attached (good will? really? that makes it seem like I'm some sort of nut they're placating, when it was a legitimate issue they partly caused. At least deride your customers behind their back and not to their face.)

I was a stay at home father for all 24 months of my daughter's life, so needless to say, I was devastated. I requested a hearing to quash the order, but Deshon Pullen and Associates told me the hearing would be vacated because they settled with the opposing counsel to remove the child from the Order of Protection. The court cited that I failed to appear, and denied our stipulated agreement without any explanation from Deshon Pullen and Associates. 
This firm did represent me at our temporary orders hearing, and our family court judge did remove my daughter from the order and award me joint custody and exclusive use of the marital residence...after not having ANY contact with my daughter for 3.5 months and after a Notice of Trustee Sale was filed to foreclose my home that I hadn't occupied for 3.5 months.

I could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.

After being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.

Turns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and ""natural"" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by "" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills"" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)

When we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?

Ok, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.

I can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!

10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!!

Our second cat ( a Siamese) was brought here for a short period of time until we switched to another clinic so that Snowball could receive better care. 

Fast forward to 2012 -- we brought our Siamese back here because we wanted to try a holistic approach to treating her chronic kidney failure.  She was treated by one of the best vets I have ever met, Dr. Anya Yuschenko. However, after a few months we returned for a regular check-up and found out that Dr. Anya had left so we were passed along to Dr. Kneebone.  All she cared about discussing was how our cat needed to have her teeth cleaned. Our cat is 16-years old with chronic kidney disease so the chance of her not surviving the anaesthesia is fairly high. Furthermore, after reviewing her blood work at home later I noticed that a few important blood tests (for a cat dealing with chronic kidney disease) was missing, or just not ordered. 

Most recently we had an emergency situation (there was blood in our cats vomit and fecal matter) so naturally, I call our vet, 1.5 hours  prior to their closing time.  Our cat was refused an appointment despite her current condition and when we stopped by the clinic to pick up her medical record  so we could take her to another clinic, there were no clients waiting to be seen.  Do not take a really sick pet here because they will not show any interest in caring for them.",11,4NLiD8-T_fR-8QjiV1GW1w

""Had brunch at the Fig on Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary and an orange cocktail (acceptable). Also ordered Biscuits & Gravy (good) and Migas (okay). But what killed our experience was the HORRENDOUS service.  

Our server, Josh, was distracted and did not check on us.  When he did come he did not demonstrate knowledge of the menu.  I asked which he would recommend, between the omelette and Migas.  He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking. When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation.

They put out a solid menu with some fantastic options and they know that Restaurant Week should be at least a little bit of a deal. (I hate restaurants that just toss three items on their menu that would've added up to $29 anyway.)

I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious, topped off with a fantastic tomato-chile-salsa type thing. My only complaint here is that it was just this side of not-warm-enough. (The Mac, not the chile stuff, which isn't supposed to be hot.) 

I also had a good several bites of the girlfriend's Stetson Chopped Salad. I understand the hype. It's at once fresh, crispy, and packed with flavor--it's more an experience than a salad. Absolutely perfect and beautiful to boot.

The scallops with beet risotto were just fantastic. The goat cheese was a masterstroke, the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the dish was just the right size for a three course--three large-ish scallops. The risotto was tasty though it could've used just a little something to perk it up, but the goat cheese did some fantastic heavy lifting on that front. Absolutely awesome.

Finally, the banana cream pudding/pie and the bread pudding. Both hit  the spot, but the banana cream felt a little less special, if that makes sense. The bread pudding was fantastic, but definitely a heavy dish after such a meal.

ajoqEHnCZTD8-8GqGLq9-Q,0,2013-10-10 22:22:35,0,ebtOQUVX4kkzAKjY1_k_bA,"I recently stayed here, not even a week ago, and it was less than okay, and I'll explain why...

1) This hotel is not located on the strip, initially I knew that, but my boyfriend was dying to stay here so I compromised, knowing that there'd be a shuttle plus he said we'd just take cabs seeing as though it was only a mile from the strip. Come to find out the shuttle ran every half hour which is horrible, & only sat 12 ppl so if you were the 13th you would have to wait until the next one came which was a whole half an hour later AND it stopped running at 8 so if you wanted to leave your hotel after 8 or come back from the strip to your hotel after 8 that's a 12 dollar cab with cash, 15 with a card (for a mile long ride!). You can see how hanging out after 8 outside of your hotel can add up in cab fees if there's only 2 of you like it was for me.

2) When checking in there were only two receptionists and they moved pretty damn slow. We checked in, I want to say around 11pm, which is probably why there were only two staff but it's a hotel, it's Vegas, people are checking in all the time, so the wait for that was a little ridiculous.

3) The wifi was Blahhh, it was very slow and I had to enter my name and room number constantly to keep connecting back to it... Annoying!

4) The food wasn't cheap at all, it was 45 bucks for my boyfriend and I to eat at the buffet which I thought would have been fitting for two ppl that didn't stay in the hotel opposed to two ppl that did BUT I will say that they served endless champagne which diffused the situation for me, they did good with that (finally!)

5) There was a $20 fee a night so when I was checking out that was $80 for me but they attempted to charge us for a Gatorade and some other item that we never used which hiked up the price. After we told them we hadn't used anything in the mini bar they did take those items off of the bill. Twenty dollars a night is still kind of ridiculous after paying hundreds of dollars for the hotel room already, don't you think?

6) At this point I'm done talking about this place! There are already too many deterring points I've made about this hotel that I just do not feel like continuing. On the ups the room was nice and newly renovated and we had two beds when we only needed one, the bathroom was really nice and the tv had cable so good job on that I guess. We were able to do one party at the ""Moon something"" for free after putting ourselves on the guest list. The party itself was a little corny but the rooftop view was pretty cool.

7) All in all if you MUST stay here it won't be your worst experience, especially if you're richer than me, lol, but I would recommend staying somewhere on the strip, it's much more convenient, some of the hotels are less expensive, and you won't have to worry about carfare after 8pm! I, however, would NEVER stay here again!",0,WSnWdc_uKEN0yuNsDqD1PQ

The food was greasy. The second trip was in response to a complaint that we called in to the restaurant. Even then, nothing improved. It is real sad to see the Taco Mac of the 1980s is now gone. The present day, cookie-cutter Taco Mac is just pathetic.

Addendum:  As you can see, my review was responded to by one of their staff.  Well, I think it is all an empty gesture.  Avoid the Taco Mac of today.  It is NOTHING like the ones that used to be scattered around Atlanta in the 1980's.  As for the response from Taco Mac, I see lots of them from the staff of Taco Mac on various reviews.  So, here's some food for thought:

1 -  Our second visit was because of a poor, disgusting visit the first time.  It was VERY apparent NOTHING had changed between the two visits.  Why would I accept a second comp visit only to rack up a THIRD horrible experience?  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on you.  Fool me a third time, I am just a f*****g idiot for going back again.

2 -  Instead of posting, ""gee, we are sorry"" comments, HOW ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEMS YOUR CHARLOTTE LOCATIONS SEEM TO HAVE?????  The Huntersville location has already closed.  It should only be a matter of time before the University and South Park locations likewise close.

Also, on another recent visit I asked for my wings to be cooked well done and/or crispy but they came out barely cooked and were disgusting.  However, I was I did'nt want a run it with the bartender so I ate about 5 and left in a hurry.  I also noticed a few other patrons who sent back their food too, maybe they have a bad chef on Sundays.  

Maybe my dad is right when he calls it the stinking lizard, yes I know cheesy, but this places food really sucks.  Also, there french fries are frozen sysco brand steak fries.

As soon as we walked in the waitress who sat us was hanging over a table eating french fries from a customers plate. She rudely asked if we were the party of 10 and brought us to our seats. When it came time to order the food the waitress (wish I got her name) was so rude it was unbelievable!! She rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed because it was a little loud and confusing with our big group. I don't care how big and loud we are, you DO NOT roll your eyes and pout like a baby to your customers. While she was picking up the menus she dropped them and said ""god damnit"" right behind us!   When our food came out it was up to us to figure out where the plates needed to go and we were missing an entr√©e. When we finally waved down the waitress she stated ""well I gave them the order there was just a lot of food"" so we decided to cancel the plate. Five minute later she drops it in front of us and says well the chef made so I wanted to give you the option to eat it. 

That was the last straw, a member from our group found a manager and explained our complete disgust with our waitress. The manager claimed to be shocked and said she was her best waitress. If she is your best waitress then that might explain why your restaurant was dead on a Saturday night.  The manager did comp all of our drinks which was 71$ but still added the 18% gratuity and a service charge. I would have paid for my drinks instead of giving the waitress our money.  


The waitresses are so concerned with catering to the 5 older regulars then the new business that is coming in. The sad part is the food was decent and the music was enjoyable they have so much potential but will not have repeat customers with those waitresses. If it wasn't for having such a big party on a Saturday night, we would have walked out upon arriving.

We made reservations for a Thursday night before a long weekend expecting it to be packed. Though not dead either, noise was never an issue. Service was spot on. 

We shared fresh raw oysters and the lobster fritters. Both dishes were amazing. I loved how many accompaniments came with the oysters. I don't love lobster but these little gems were amazing!

For my entree I had the grilled sea bass. Incredible piece of fish. Good sized portion. I loved the sauce it came with - good heat and full flavor. 

On our waiter's recommendation we shared the black truffle cavatelli as one of our sides (though it's on the appy menu). Good flavor but the oils had separated. The grilled asparagus was super fresh.

We ordered wine a la carte. 

We hardly ever eat dessert but couldn't resist the toasted coconut cheesecake bites. Wow... delicious.

I came here on a Saturday night around 8pm hoping to avoid the dinner rush, but it was still packed, so I recommend making a reservation as early as possible. The restaurant is tucked away on a quiet corner away from the strip, but inside it's bustling with lots of happy guests eating high quality and authentic Thai food served in a classy and modern environment. There are a lot of parking spaces too!

They have quite the extensive menu, and like some other Yelp reviews have mentioned, it really does seem like almost anything you order here is good. I had the $5 Cup of Tom Yum Kai Soup and the $12.95 Pad Thai with Chicken (just felt like trying a classic this time). I ordered the soup at a spice level of 3 out of 10, which is a little less spicy than sriracha, and it came with tenderly cooked chicken, tomatoes, and mushrooms that were soft but had that delightful hint of nuttiness/earthiness. The Pad Thai was some of the best pad thai I've ever had and I had no complaints there.

I'd recommend coming to Lotus of Siam with a group of 4 and getting a large pot of Tom Yum soup, rice on the side, and then sharing a few a la carte orders such as chicken and/or curry dishes. The Stuffed Chicken Wings and Nam Kao Tod appetizers looked good too.

Overall, if you're in in the mood for some good Asian food or specifically to get your Thai food fix, then you can't go wrong with the great service and authentic, delicious food at Lotus of Siam.",1,Zv0fJ2QvjJQKjdS3mTgPAQ

We had a great experience overall with Tom's Camperland.  We drove all the way from Connecticut to pick up our new trailer, since our sales rep Allen gave us a very competitive deal on a fully loaded new unit we could simply not refuse.  At the time of our pick up, we had plenty of time to do our orientation and the pre-delivery inspection.  From the moment we walked in the door, the receptionist and people on the floor were very welcoming.  The service staff (with particular shout outs to Adon and Andy) was very accommodating and they showed us all the systems inside and out, with water and electric hooked up, including the AC.  I was also pleased they went over the hitch setup process with great detail.  Since I am new to towing, one of the staff rode with us around the city neighborhood to get a sense of how the rig would handle, how to handle turns, braking, backing up, etc., which was greatly appreciated.  Throughout the entire process, everyone at Tom's was responsive to our many questions and concerns.

We spent 10 nights in the Mesa vicinity at two lovely desert parks, Usery Mountain and Lost Dutchman, for our local shakedown.  Camping there in early April was delightful.

I thought it was going to be another one of those multi-hyphenated cookie-cutter sushi place around Montreal. But my reservations were thwarted, slightly, by the fact that it's name has the word ""ramen' on it. I HAD to give it a try especially when that picture of a bowl of ramen looked so inviting, and I was a glad I did. 

I love ramen and I love it even more when it is done right. My favorite ramen on Ramen-ya's menu is their chasumen shoyu ramen and all the dumpling types they have on their menu. There are four soup flavors, shoyu, miso, spicy miso and curry. While some purist might even shun at the idea of having multiple kinds of ramen instead of specializing in one, I kind of like it that there are options. Never mind that the owners are Chinese but let us not get into the history of noodles. This is as good as it gets with bowl of piping hot, soothing, tasty ramen with a nice slice of roasted pork, complementary veggies and seriously delicious looking floating globules of glistening fat that's just the right amount.

Also, try their zaru soba dishes. Their tempura shrimp zaru soba is simply out of this world. It's the perfect cold noodle dish for a summer's day. I was never a fan of cold noodles until now, that is. 

I am really glad I found a joint I could hangout and have a delicious meal for lunch during work hours. And I have now earned a title as their frequent client by now, I suppose, I have been back more than 10 times in 3 weeks.

Skirt steak- had to take a picture. Incredible flavor AND it's tender. Now how do they accomplish both? Nice job!
Grace and I both ordered skirt steak (hers medium, mine medium rare). Both came out perfectly cooked but mine was half as thick as hers - I kinda got ripped off.  This is my ONLY minus for the night and only reason for 4 stars.

The lady I dealt with this time on the phone was much more pleasant to deal with and she provided the information I needed in a timely manner and was good with answering my questions.  She did apologize for my experience at the clinic from before and said that they took my review seriously and talked to all staff since then to improve customer service to ensure poor service does not happen again.  She said she did not want to lose me as a customer.  I did appreciate this a lot, but still feel it is only fair to leave my review below up as it is an accurate account of my actual experience there.  Until I am able to attend the clinic again in person and see if I do get good customer service with an appointment that is on time and honored, I obviously can't rate a better score until it actually happens.  However, I will at least give this good bit of review for all potential customers, still consider coming to this clinic for the optometrist and for the other good reception staff that I unfortunately never had the chance to deal with in person.

Original review:
I completely agree with the other review.  While the optometrist was nice and thorough, the overall experience was made terrible due to the horrible customer service provided by the reception staff.  Twice in a row they made us wait over 30 minutes even though we had appointments.  Both times they failed to let us know that the doctor would be late or give us any updates on why we were waiting so long.  They thought it was acceptable to just let us wait aimlessly.  One of the reception staff tried to address our wait time after 30 minutes had gone by with excuses. I ended up catching her in a lie and then she had the nerve to turn it around and blame me for the wait time, then shook her head while she walked away.  She even admitted they took a walk-in patient 5 minutes before our appointment and saw no wrong in this. Their only solution for doing this to us was to wait endlessly or come back another time.  Never have I had such terrible customer service!  I will never come back again and congrats to losing a customer within 2 visits in 2 weeks!  That has to be some sort of record!  It's sad that the optometrist will have to lose customers due to the reception staff.  Would definitely not recommend this place if you're looking for good customer service.",3,kt1Wi-ir1vx1X_DkV0xDmg

The location looks like a small place from the parking lot since there's not much retail frontage. Inside it fits a fair number of people and can accommodate big groups due to the casual tables and chairs. First off, it's very warm and smoky from the kitchen being an open concept beside the dinning area and the lava stones blasting smoke from most tables. I was sweating and smelled like bbq meat when I left.  I don't think there is any air conditioning, just circulating fans.  Don't wear your Sunday best to come eat here. 

Service was good. They were attentive, explained things well and made us feel welcome.  The food came quick and hot. I was a little disappointed they did not have the non alcoholic drinks in stock that are advertised in the menu, nor was there a chef special dessert as offered on the menu.

We tried a lot of food and it was all good. We were all sharing, since each meal looked so good. The calamari had a wonderful corn breading and came with tasty sauces to dip into. The paella was quite spicy but was so flavourful with sausage, mussels and rice. The sirloin steak on the hot lava stone was great to share as we could cut up the streak and cook the pieces to each persons desired wellness. The steak was delicious and came with salad and spiced fries. The side rib (one big single one) was so tender and fell off the bone. Their bbq sauce is bold and zippy, and there was a second sauce that was extra spicy (I preferred the milder one). The lamb shank also fell off the bone and was a good size piece including marrow in the bone, it was served with the same bbq sauce as the rib. The veggies were well cooked and the mash was smooth and creamy.  The portion sizes are plentiful, we all had a little left over to take home.  It was a meat/carb heavy meal but I like that they came with salads or vegetables to help balance it out a little.  The tiramisu and chocolate moose were also very nice and big portions that could be shared.  Over all a really good meal. 

Next time I want to try the wings appetizer, or maybe the jerk, or the  fillet steak (8 oz).  It all looks so good.",1,9YAcyOPntf2HJszcWgkLow

Yes the car was fine, but the business practices were shady.

We booked and pre-paid for our car on-line, like we've done dozens of times with all of the various rental companies. We declined the extra insurance like we always do because we know our own MV insurance will cover us.

The line at the registration desk was ridiculous -an hour long with no exaggeration. When we hit the desk, they pulled up our reservation and asked if we wanted the extra insurance, which was curious because we already paid and declined it. We said we didn't need it.

When we turned the car in, we saw hundreds of dollars in unauthorized charges for things like insurance and bogus gas charges (we returned the car with a full tank.

We disputed the charge with our credit card vendor and they were able to get a partial concession from Budget, but I can't describe how deplorable the whole experience was and how downright shady and sleazy Budget was.

Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! 

I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. 

The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. 

Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience.

The ticket prices are fairly reasonable and 
includes your return trip. A ticket for an adult is about $8. They offer discounts for seniors, ages 15-19, and under 14. Children under 2 are free.

It is encouraged to buy tickets online so you don't have to wait in lines and have a chance of missing the ferry.

In the event you miss the ferry, you can purchase the tickets and walk around before entering the ferry waiting area.

I knew I had to go here when I heard of the bacon jam. Wait a sec, BACON JAM. I don't think there's anything as inventive as this amazing contraption. 

When we got there, I was assuming for a long line but we arrived around 10 AM which seemed to be an ideal time for a Sunday morning. No line, but the venue was full and busy. We sat cramped in between two other guests who were enjoying their food when our server asked if we were ready to order. 

Rather hopeful about the dishes, I opted for their classic which was the TNB Cafe Signature Hamburger. Now before I begin, I just want you to know that my favorite burger is located in Santa Monica, CA which taunts me to this day because it's not always available for me to have due to distance. So knowing that I have fund my favorite burger is Godsend. 

This burger consisted of Angus patty topped with crispy baked mac n' cheese and our signature bacon jam with sriracha mayo. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant to get it since it sounded a little busy, but I went with my gut. 

The wait time to receive this order was rather fast. And when we got it, many people around our general direction looked at what we were having. The woman next to me even bothered to ask what it was. The burger looked like a piece of art. And it was just as good as it looked. Filled with flavor that was synchronized all together. A hint of spice, salt, sweet, but nothing was overpowering each other. Along with the texture of the mac and cheese and the bacon jam which added the crunch, WOW. It's so hard to describe how delicious this burger was. 

My meal came with a salad which seemed like the polar opposite. You can add fries, but honestly, it was a lot of food to begin with. 

Now, the final question is, would I come back? The answer is straight up, YES! There's no doubt they'll be seeing me more often here. This is truly a hole in the wall.",3,PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w

But customer service is not about ""getting out of there."" it's about getting customers what they need and pay for. Being rude is fine, I can handle that. But when we got our pizza and bread sticks, the pizza was very undercooked and wet, and the bread sticks tasted like domino's before they revamped their image. Nevermind the fact that the person on the phone said order now or never, we ordered a medium 2 topping pizza and bread sticks from $20. The only reason my girlfriend said wait 30 seconds is because I was checking online for a deal. I could have gotten twice as much for the same price.

The deliver and setup.  WE bought stuff that was brand new because it come from a design center showroom.  Stuff moves fast here.  WE walked in and they were removing a couch from the showroom.  AS we walked around, they put another couch down in its place.  We looked at it and wife thought she might like it.  A minute later, someone else was sitting in it and deciding if they wanted it.  I grabbed the tag off of it, much to the disappointment of the other people who were trying to make their mind up.  The point is, if you see something you like, make a fast decision because the shelf life at this place is very short.
 Nice $29 lamps, $39 upholstered chairs. Great deals on complete bedroom sets.

He said he would be able to get to me within an hour and a half and he delivered on that promise. The job took no more than 20 minutes and I was back up and running by around 9 PM. This is pure customer service, no runarounds, no salesman tricks, just honest upfront service at a very competitive price. This is exactly the type of owner/operator business that yelp is perfectly designed to connect to customers that are looking for great service and a great deal.

The meal was exquisite.  Each course was inventive, beautiful and incredibly delicious.  The wine pairings were among the best we have experienced anywhere and were pitch perfect.

There are people working on their laptops or hanging out with friends. Their specialty is their vegan waffle. Either sweet or savory they have options for both.

There is a a big board on the left when you walk in for the menu. The customer service at the ordering  counter has been consistently friendly. I've had the West Coast waffle sandwich and that has chicken, avocado, bacon, and their signature aioli sauce. I really like it, but sometimes I get it without the bacon. Their chicken waffledilla is a quesadilla made out of waffle instead of tortilla. Very cheesy and hits the spot when you're in need of comfort food. The only drawback is that sometimes the food takes a while to come out. I've tried calling ahead for pick up, but was put on hold for a while and ended up driving there instead. However, I'm never disappointed when I get my food though. 

I do want to differentiate that this particular shop has a more soft and fluffy texture than a super crispy outside kind of waffle. I personally like the softer version, but for some people the waffle texture was too one noted. I have yet to try their dessert versions, but the strawberry and whipped cream seems to be very popular when I've dined in. The prices are very affordable too. Lunch with a drink will be around under ten bucks. All in all, it's a cool and casual spot worth giving at least a try.

I have been a long time shopper of the south park location but has never really bought much of anything from the store, I think I own more non-clothing items than clothing-items from them. Reason being, I feel like even the sale items are not affordable enough. However, I spotted some great clearance items today and picked up 2 dresses and a skirt. 

My best experience was the fitting room. The lady who was working the fitting room(blonde, wavy long hair, petite, tan) was very courteous. I can easily say it is the top 3 fitting room experiences I've had in my life. She greeted me immediately after I walked into the fitting room area, took the clothes off my hands. Then she hung my clothes up in different sections in the room. Asked for my name, introduced herself and wrote my name outside the door and told me if i needed a different size or something to go with any piece, just let her know. Now, everything up until now may seem pretty standard for an athro experience, however...after being in the room for about 5 min, she checked on me by calling me by my first name, asked if i have any clothes i do not want and wants to take out from the fitting room...that is very nice of her, who doesn't want a less cramped space? lastly, when i was finally done with trying out my clothes, she was still very pleasant, said it was a pleasure and smiled the whole time. Let me just say, I am sure working the fitting room can be QUITE annoying, so she is definitely very good at it, I wish I could tip her!

9phmfcCbJPpxHGE0_lQnOQ,0,2018-07-23 18:19:05,0,IbiCBoDaw6WtXV3lraANHg,"Just finished driving beside a Five Star cube truck (in Calgary) and to keep up to him I had to drive 90km/hr on Memorial Drive (which has a posted 70km speed limit). As I pulled up beside the vehicle at a red light (just above Deerfoot Trail, by the zoo), I looked over and saw the gentleman with his cell phone up to his face. What makes this even more disheartening, in today's world of business. So I called on my Bluetooth the number on the van and left a message for a ""Jason"", with my name and phone number. I arrived back at work and Jason had returned my call. Well, as the Manager of 5 Star Seniors Relocators, I explained to Jason that the vehicle which I briefly caught up to was doing 90km on a 70km road, his 1st response was, ""The vehicle was empty"". He then defended the driver, by saying, that he was only doing 82km. How he knew that....... Jason was in the vehicle with the driver....OMG
Jason became very argumentative with me yelling at me that his driver was ONLY doing 82km in a 70km (on Memorial Drive). I did respond with 90km, which is exactly what his driver was travelling at. I then asked him why his driver was on his cell phone while in a running vehicle and possibly even while driving. I expressed to him that with him being a manager, that doesn't seem to be the best scenario for the employees having him as a manger and allowing them to break the law, with him beside them. Jason abruptly  hung up the phone on me. So as a consumer, who has grand parents and many of my friends have grand parents in senior's facilities, I would strongly suggest going with a different moving company. If you have used them before and something got broken, its because they drive TOO fast and don't support defensive driving techniques. As well, if you have complained and dealt with Jason, which turned out to be a negative experience, don't worry because ignorance is probably his only trait and as a business owner, I would have never hired a person of such poor business manners and extremely poor ethics. Five Star Seniors Relocators is a terrible company to deal with, simply because they employ Jason and are extremely poor decision makers when it comes to hiring/training drivers (which is the only way to transport any seniors precious belongings), in a city of 1.4 million potential customers.",0,iUQ2B7p6Df6OwRz9JwRCFQ

The beer selection is insane, way better than any other bar I've been to in the area.

Hough's is a nice place to go and watch a game. I'ts pretty big for Pittsburgh standards, and there are plenty of tables and TVs available.

I love restaurants in old houses. I loved the dim lighting and relaxing environment. It was classy but still comfortable. This would be a great option for a date. Our service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly and relaxed but still on top of everything. I noticed that the busser was a little more aggressive... reaching over people to grab plates or pour water... but it was not a big deal.

To start off, I got the beet carpaccio. This was a delicious dish. Even though there was not a whole lot of it on the plate, there were still many different flavors to enjoy. Sour from the lime vinaigrette, sweet from the dollops of coconut pudding and hibiscus syrup, and spicy from the thinly sliced jalapeno. Best part was the golden beets which tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked. My dining companions got the corn chowder which they both raved about as well. For entrees, the three of us got one of each items offered and all were pretty tasty. The paella was savory goodness but the shrimp maybe could have used a little more seasoning or flavor. My chicken dish once again kept me entertained with multiple flavor profiles. The briny and mustardy brussel sprouts chiffonade was almost like a German sauerkraut. The chicken was rich, flavorful, roasted dark meat. And the biscuit and apple butter gave it just a touch of sweetness. Really good plate and it was arranged so that you could get a bit of each in every bite. For dessert the other two girls ordered the chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse. They both loved this!! I had a bite and I have to say it was pretty darn good. The mousse had a very roasted peanut flavor and was not too sweet and the chocolate cake was simple and the perfect accompaniment. My friend even talked the waiter into giving her some more mousse to go when he boxed up the rest of her cake. I ordered the sweet potato cheesecake to my surprise was deconstructed and served in the style of a pot de cr√®me. Still very delicious but although I love tamarind flavor, the cubes of gelatin in this dish were out of place both in texture and flavor. They should have just been left out altogether.

The one huge plus I'll give the staff is that my lovely companion left some jewelery in our room when we checked out. We called the staff and they were able to track it down for us and return it to us within about an hour of us calling. Awesome. However, a major staff problem was the housekeeping - when we checked in - our room was simply not clean. Don't get me wrong - it had been ""cleaned"". But it had trash on the ground. And some of the seats were incredibly dusty. I mean like you could write ""wash me"" with your fingertip on the seats. That dusty.

The pools were also a major issue. They close early (I think at 6 PM or something like that). Am I the only person in the world that loves going to pools at night? Further, the main pool was closed off for much of our time there for some show that cost $100/person (or was it $50/person? Staff gave conflicting information here). Thus we were stuck in the teeny little pool in Palms Place. There was no seating available (though a nice maintenance guy was able to hook me up when I asked), but there were tons of empty cabanas (that they were chasing people out of) that I suspect they wanted some insane price for. The bartenders at the pool were awful (incompetent and rude). Also, charging $12 for a rum and coke is insane.

Getting to and from the strip is about a $15 taxi ride. There is a shuttle that goes to/from the strip once per day. Literally once. No airport service, of course (that's about $25). There is a ""resort fee"" of $15/day. They're quick to tell you that gets you a $20 drink credit. That credit only works at bars in the casino, and it doesn't go too far (though they are less overpriced than the pool). It also expires the day it is issued for.

Service/staff/location/pools get minus 5 stars.
The actual rooms get 4.5 stars.

I'm not good at math so somehow that's becoming three stars.",3,7jRqME7-krCDvdkR-dadgA

From the stubbly copper-clad bar to the dark heavy-wooded interior to the bottles of loveliness tucked away behind the Winekeeper glass, Yn was just pure. From a wine girl whose head swirls around at the word Turley, who eats up AVA descriptions like candy, who can spot the bold black-and-white Charles Smith label from across the bar, who savors the words ""St Helena"" like a cartographer would drool over a hidden treasure map, this is pure perfection.

Options? Yes. The wine list is organized by flights (sparkling, and multiple reds and whites), but for each glass in the flight you can also simply purchase it by 2.5 or 5 ounce pour, or the entire bottle. Yn offers an excellent mix of wineries you probably think you heard of once somewhere in a New York Times article a year ago and told yourself you should check out one of these days but never did: just off the beaten path, with cred and substance. For the flights, you get a little diagram of fruit and fullness (good for the novice), but also a nice taste description complete not only with AVA but sourced vineyard(s) and winemaker, perfect for someone like me who loves more information

Additionally, there's a nice little tapas and full plate menu (from the restaurant next door, 131 Main) in case you need to simultaneously nibble and imbibe. (You can also order cocktails from next door's bar if wine or bottled beer isn't your thing.) Nimbibe, immible, whatever....It's all good. Take a minute to also check out the sinks in the bathroom: Seattle architecture has nothing on these.

Finally, a shout-out to Laura, the wonderfully skilled bartender/wine expert who made our night so perfect! I wish I had someone in my town who knew (simply from walking by and remembering my flights) which two glasses of wine I was struggling to choose between and saved me by suggesting a half of each....Brilliant! 

My glass: an '04 Falcor Syrah, if you must know. And love. Like me....",5,MNeCv2lwx_iujQFUsNKLgg

I live pretty close by so i go their often for lunch when i'm to lazy to cook for myself or i go when my family wants to go as well.

I suggest going with a group but going with a group or family around peak hours (lunch and dinner) as it may feel a little awkward eating alone but out side of that its pretty quiet there.

I really enjoy the service as the waitresses are very friendly, food portions are pretty huge and tastes great. prices seem pretty fair and if you bring friends to split the bills on side dishes its even better!

My favourite thing to get is the Jajang myun (black bean noodles) tang soo yuuk (sweet and salty sauce on deep fried pork strips)  split bowls. they have combo deals with sides and main dishes for groups and stuff also so i suggest that when you in groups! They also do take out so you can bring the food home and eat it! 

On weekends it gets pretty backed so i suggest you make reservations if possible also, so if you plan on eating and want it to be quiet i suggest you avoid weekends and just order takeout!",0,XPVbuYVsm_fLo_pKoj1xHw

The best thing about this beach is the nice, gradual slope in the swimming area. It doesn't just drop off like most other beaches in the area. You walk out a few feet in some really ouchy rocks but then it becomes really soft and sandy. There's a really cool sand bar here that allows you to be further out and actually sit and hang out in the water. 

It's very clean -- you won't see any needles or used rubbers laying around in the sand. The sand is hot as hell and not very soft but shit, it's better than being chock full of stuff with bodily fluids on it. 

Parking is $3 if you're not a resident of Lake county. If you are, it's $2. 

There are many amenities: lifeguards, a concession stand, clean bathrooms!, showers, pavilions, grills, nice playgrounds for kids, volleyball courts, free life jacket rentals, and Surf Chair's for people with disabilities. You can rent kayaks for pretty cheap -- single = $10 per hour or double = $15 per hour. Also, stand-up paddleboards = $10 per hour. 

If you have four-legged friends, there's a dog swim area as well. 

The worst part is that if you look to the east you'll see that horrible monstrosity that is the Perry Nuclear Power Plant. Try not to look at it and let it ruin your day.

I get slot comps often for food at the Palms, and this usually means grabbing something at the Food Court on my way out the door. The last time I did this will be last for the following reasons. 

1. The McDonalds at the Palms makes you pay for any amount above your comp with cash only. No Credit or Debit cards no matter how much the difference is. This sucks if you have just lost all your cash in a machine and are hungry. I am not going to an ATM and pay a $5 fee to get more cash so I can use a $10 comp. 

2. After dealing with the above I finally placed an order for less than $10 bucks to use my comp only to see a big cockroach running across the counter as I was getting my drink. The manager in charge at the time seemed shocked that I no longer wanted to eat my food. She acted like cockroaches crawling about was just a normal part of her day. 

3. If one establishment in the food court has such a problem with cockroaches then how many others in this part of the hotel do? Is this a problem with the entire hotel? Either way I am not going to use my food comps any more this will more than likely mean I will spend less money playing slots at the palms.

I've been told that if you've come down with a bad case of the cold, you must get the Koryo Samgyetang (I mean... they ARE named after it...). Boiled down, it's the Korean version of chicken noodle soup, but with a few different ingredients: ginseng, sticky rice, Korean dates and chestnuts that are stuffed inside a miniature chicken. Your order also comes with a small plate of noodles that you drop in the soup.

Key note: the soup itself is a bit plain, but that's normal. They let you control the amount of salt that goes in. Taste it first, and adjust accordingly.

Once you got the seasoning down, the dish itself is really delicious. The chicken is really soft and tender, the Korean dates give it a nice sweetness, and the rest help bring it all together.

I took a small bite of the wife's Dolsot Bibimbap and her words, although as funny as it sounds, rings kind of true: ""It's too healthy..."" Maybe that's a good thing? Maybe it's not. Take it with a grain of salt... it's literally there on your table :)

The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.

A. Being told 30 minutes into my foils that they were experimenting with a new product and having the product representative coming and checking on me.

B. Being told 45 minutes into my foils that my hair was WHITE and burning and needed to be rinsed immediately.

C. Watching LITERAL clumps of my hair falling out while towel drying and still having more than half of my hair to finish.

D. Having three employees whispering in the corner about that the plan of action was to fix my thoroughly damaged hair, and not informing me of what was going on.

E. Being charged $250 for the outcome.

The stylist was very sweet and tried her best to rectify the damage, but as a result of that highlight, I had to cut off nearly 6 inches of previously healthy hair and it still doesn't feel the same.  While the color itself looks great, it was truly bad business and I will not be back.

I actually remember the old Pittsburgh airport. I've done a ton of flying out of both the old and this new(er) version and the new(er) version is a complete improvement. Still, I wish the food options were more plentiful, open later, and spread more equally throughout the concourses. Security here is relatively tame (line speaking) when compared to more heavily traveled airports. PIT is no longer a HUB so it sees much less traffic these days. It's easy to navigate, there are no insanely long walks to terminals (I'm looking at you DCA!), and it's, relatively, clean. Moving walkways are always good, I never find this airport crowded, and if you forget reading material for your flight (I'm very guilty of this), there are abundant outposts to grab media to read. I appreciate there is free drop-off parking if you're there less than an hour since I and my brother semi-frequently fly here to visit my parents and need dropped off after. I know my parents, as Pittsburgh residents, wish there were more direct flights out of PIT. Even my brother, flying home to Boston, recently had to connect from PIT to Newark (???) then to Boston-I'm not sure why they couldn't do a direct flight more than once a day (which is why he had to book connecting) for that. Staff is at least good with kids-I've flown numerous times as a minor (many, many moons ago) alone and I always had a good experience. My  parents say security is now quick, but they also fly pretty frequently and are pre-approved for TSA. Overall, I think the breadth of flights was better when Pittsburgh was still a HUB, but it (mostly) gets our divided (by distance) family to where we need to go so that's a plus still!",1,gFsqraWQfG46ohVFRg_d3A

 I agree with some people mentioning it's pricey but seriously, it's reasonable. I mean, you want quality food then you pay for quality food. For instance, it's like Mortan's Steakhouse, if you order a rib eye steak, you going to pay at least $100 at Mortan's for one. But the quality and flavor is there and thats what keeps you coming back for more. There are so many cheapsakes out there that rather eat crapy food for cheap and complain about this place, instead of comparing the quality of food to other places and realizing that this place is actually reasonable.
 Also, the variety of the food they offer is exceptional. Always FRESH!! Made for the vegetarian, the meat lover, the kids, and of course for you and me. 
Furthermore, the customer service here is phenomenal. I happened to meet the owners wife(and mother of his children) and not only is she appealing and charming, she was extremely delightful, young and reverent. I haven't seen her recently (which I hope she comes back soon) but it's ALWAYS a pleasure to walk in and see her there smiling lovely.

We looked forward to meeting for lunch at their location  in the strip district all week long and got there with eager anticipation. Luckily for us, they did not disappoint! We had studied their menu online beforehand so we could game plan what we would order and share. 

We ordered one cold served Maine style lobster roll, one warm served Connecticut style lobster roll and their lobster tater tots. On the way down, we stopped at a Get Go for some Iron City Light beers to accompany lunch because you need some ""bee-ah"" for your ""lobstah"" rolls. I wish they had forks for their lobster tater tots because it was pretty impossible to eat without one with all that was going on, but I managed.

Book a tour in advance, this is the only way you can visit the museum. You can book student tickets online just be sure to bring your student ID with you when you visit. Our tour guide was so nice, I have her to thank for leading us to the Container Park which is located on Fremont and 7th, a five minute walk from the casino madness also on Fremont and 4th. 

Las Vegas is full of history, most of it has been forgotten due to old hotels being taken down and rebuild by new owners and developers. The folks at Neon Museum do their best in getting their hands on as many Neon signs as possible in hopes to preserve them and hopefully to restore them back to life. You'll learn all this and a lot more if you visit the Neon Museum and go on the tour. The one thing I wish was that they'll let you take photos after or before the tour, but because there are so many tours one after another they don't let you. Super clean and cute facility. 

Nevada recognizes the Neone Museum's efforts in preserving Las Vegas's history and now has their back and helps them out every way that they can. One way they help out is by renting them their land for $1 a year so they can use the money from ticketing, the gift shop, and donations towards running the museum and preserving these marvelous pieces of art. The passion and love from the entire staff is touching, you just know you're visiting a place that is important to the state. There were more locals than tourists on our tour, which tells me it has more cultural significance than tourism... you can also rent out a private lot in the back for weddings or private events. 

Tickets are extremely reasonably priced. $18 for adults and $12 for students. Parking is free. It's a private non profit.

Tips: We went on a day time tour at 3pm, we kind of wish we had booked it a little later around 4pm due to the heat. There are umbrellas they will loan you for free for your tour, you leave your ID with them in exchange. Family friendly. Only a few of the signs work at night, the photos come out better during the day time. Walk in is ok, but they recommend booking in advance, depending on how booked the tours are you could walk in and hop on a tour or they might book you for the following day.  If you want to expand your neon experience visit Fremont and be sure to goto the Container Store, The Writers Block, and check out the Downtown Podcast.",4,0-9YVzOkL51P7rtlaLBp9g

If the end of the world is upon us I'm running to the South Park Mall because they have all the food, shelter, clothing and essentials I could ever want. Plus they have those nifty fountains, so that would become my new bathtub. 

Seriously, this place is so big, every time I've gone I have parked in a different location because I end up somewhere different each time. This is the only mall I've ever been able to tell someone to take a right off of a road onto one of 3 streets and they'd still get there! 

This mall is one of the nicest malls I've ever seen and it's all on one floor, no pesky escalators here. I'm not usually one of the hoitey toitey types because I think you can get reasonably priced stuff at other locations, but I enjoy just walking through this mall, and have even been convinced to open my wallet a little wider when I do so. 

My only complaint about this place is the food court. For such a big mall, I really expected more. To be quite honest, the food court is pretty lame and expensive. I can get Chipotle by my house, and it's your typical Chinese food locations, Showmars, Hagen Daas & other forgettable stuff.

For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

Catering to those who want to drink, dance, and play some games, it offers a very unique atmosphere. Let's start off with the drinking. Drink prices are not the cheapest but are pretty standard fair for a bar on Freemont Street East, ranging from 5-10. They do tend to pour heavy on the drinks I've had. Instead of playing sports on their televisions above the bar they give you the option to play Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 games by trading your ID for a remote or pair. In my most recent visit they were playing the movie Akira in it's entirety on a few of their televisions. While I do love the idea of being able to play games at the bar while you drink, at times it overcrowds the bar with people just playing games and makes it difficult to get a drink at times. 
Now on the gaming side they have old school arcade machines all along the left wall and they also have their version of bottle service, which includes a couch for you to sit on and a personal television for your group to pick and play games from a list of retro games they have available. They also have the couch television combo available without a bottle but they charge an hourly price for reserving one. I have yet to reserve a couch so I can't report on how much the couch reservations or bottles cost. They have quite a number of old school arcade machines along the wall which at times have technical problems or have faulty controls but the majority of the machines work well. I've also seen a technician working on the machines during the night. 
The dance floor is a bit small and suprisingly packed the majority of the night. I love the DJs that are there during the weekend, they play a good mix of top 40, old school, and they throw in some video game remixes in just for good measure. I have not been to Insert Coin on a weekday but with its combination of drinks, dance, and games it's definitely worth checking out to see if it fits your vibe.",6,eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q

Barbacoa, albeit the meat was cold, had good flavor.  Pork was also good, but overall it's not a meal I would find myself craving.  Salsas were great, and the margarita was excellent.

With all the hype, design, and work to have this place open in our neighborhood, I expected more on the menu.  You have $3.50 tacos, chips/salsa, and a couple other appetizer type foods that could rival a food truck - not a full service restaurant.

Are you a French restaurant? Yes you are. Are you a little bit touristy? Maybe. But that's a little bit of your charm, I think. You don't have a bright red exterior and lots of advertising on the outside of your restaurant if you're not, you know, trying to advertise to the passersby, so I think they're owning it.

And there's nothing inherently wrong. I myself am, begrudgingly admitting that I fit that description, and after a long flight across the country I was ravenous and just looking for a nice place to eat outside, breathe the Montreal air and listen to the Montreal sounds. I wanted to eat, and just be still after moving so fast all day long. 

That's what I did.

I walked up and was seated immediately out front, as the street this is located on is closed to all vehicle traffic. It's a lovely walkway and there's a fountain nearby, with lots of foot traffic and peoplewatching to be had. The diners around me all spoke French but laughed in the universal language of good times, and I ordered.

I started with the chevre salad, which was not what I was expecting but somehow even better. A small pot of hot chevre and a couple of toast points accompanied a salad of greens, split cherry tomatoes, and onions lightly dressed. I scooped, I stabbed, and I inhaled it all. Lovely.

The lamb shank came next and it was rich and hearty and filling. The veggies that accompanied it were cooked but cold in the middle, which was the only down point, but I left so very stuffed and relieved from my journey that I wasn't bothered.

The service was so quick and efficient, and I think my favorite little bit of all was the restroom in its black-and-white tile glory. So cute! The whole building--three stories--seems lovely. Not a soul was upstairs and only one party dined inside, but in winter I bet this is a wonderful place to sit and look down on the snowy streets below. Another reason to mark this and come back in another time.",8,HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw

I thought I didn't need to as the food and reputation should speak for itself. Then I finally read some reviews and now feel I NEED to do one. So, I started coming here when Ibby's moved to new management and Antoine took over. My husband told me we should try it, and so we did and have been coming here ever since. All food is cooked to order, which I love way better than chicken or fish that sits under a lamp! So this means it will be a minimum of 10 mins and that's okay with me. My food has always been delicious, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I can speak to the juiciness of the fried chicken and delicious baked smothered turkey legs. The rice is amazing and I'm really picky about my rice as I prefer Jasmine. The gravy is amazing to not have any flour in it! I don't do cheese so I can't speak to the macaroni and cheese taste, but my husband and kids love it! The macaroni from what I hear has changed along the way and I think that's because Ibby's listens to their patrons and learns from any past inconsistencies. I love that with every meal you get a free drink and I believe the prices fall in line with soul food/fish fry places from where I'm from which is the Bay Area. The generous 3 sides with dinners are very filling. The greens are clean, tasty and not runny and freezer-like and not over seasoned. When I come here I have many dishes. Usually when I have a place that I love to go to I only have one dish that's my favorite. At Ibby's on any given day I can order from at least 5 different meals. I love the catfish, the fried chicken, the baked chicken, the baked turkey legs and shrimp! The sweet potatoes and cobbler are my favs as well and you will not be disappointed! I've also been to other restaurants nearby (Ezekiel's/LoLo's) and I honestly can't find one that compares. When we first started going there I was really antisocial. But everyone there makes you feel like family and they'll remember you if you go often. If you personally had a problem with your order, speak to Antoine, he will make sure you walk out pleased. The best part about eating here is that I don't leave feeling overwhelmingly heavy and guilty. Have you ever ate fried chicken or fish and felt bogged down afterwards? That's what I love about the cooking here! They deliver AND you can call ahead to place your order! It's been challenging for me to find a place where the food is as good as its rumored to be.

I like the theme it had, but as far as aquariums go it wasn't anything special.  We paid for admission through a discount package bought over at The Luxor which included admission to an IMAX movie, their corny ass motion simulator ""ride film"", the king tut recreation museum, and shark reef.

The self guided audio tour is pretty cool,. but they talk about a Tiger shark with these massive teeth... I figured that'd be the coolest shark to see.  No go... didn't see a damn one, despite spending almost half an hour just in that section listening to the audio information while starring out at the fish.

The people who work here are runners themselves and are trained to look at the wear patterns of your old running shoes (if you're already a runner or walker, bring your last pair of shoes!), as well as your gait on a treadmill, to determine what your needs are in a running shoe.  They don't offer computerized gait analysis, but that's pretty much the only thing they DON'T do when they're fitting you for a pair of running shoes.  They're also pretty rigorous about making sure that you're in the correct size of shoe for your feet, which some local places don't take all that much trouble to check.  Plus, you can take shoes out into the parking lot for a brief test run, which I find better than testing shoes on the treadmill (95% of my running is out on the street, so...)

I run about 20-25 miles per week, and I have some biomechanical idiosyncrasies that can easily lead to my getting hurt if I'm not in the right shoes.  Elite has done a great job of putting me in appropriate shoes so far.  They're understanding if cost is a bit of a factor in your decision, and I trust that they're looking to make sure your needs are met rather than trying to sell you the most-expensive shoe in the store.  So don't be the jerk who goes there, spends an hour getting fitted and testing out different models, and then leaves and buys the shoes on the Internet to save $20.

The signature bao is very strongly flavoured and may induce thirst. But the dough was not too thick and the filling was relatively generous. Not sure if the other baos are as strongly flavoured.

What I like about this place is that they could have marked the prices up on their product, especially their ice cream sandwiches, but they didn't. For $1.50 a scoop or $2.50 an ice cream sandwich, you are on your way to a good dessert. If your not looking for ice cream, you can buy the cookies alone or brownies. I didn't see how much the brownies were, but the cookies are $0.50. I appreciate a company that is not greedy. It says a lot about the owners.

The cookies were nothing special, but it provided a nice little crunch with my ice cream. I ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with my rockie road ice cream. Sometimes, chocolate ice cream is too much for me so the cookie helps break it up a little for me.",4,-YG1tE3xBx5ePEId38MZqQ

Their staff also speaks pretty good English, so it's not a big deal if you speak no French (my friend was very happy). Not only that, but one of them consistently organizes evening outings that usually include trips to clubs or bars. I met a lot of people this way!

Their prices are good, considering that you get free breakfast. My friend and I were able to share a room with a bunk bed in a small apartment room for about $270 for 5-6 nights. 

They provide you with fresh and clean linens, and the bathrooms are well kept after. 

I personally like the place because it's somewhat of a labyrinth. They have cozy couches in the main common room, and plenty of table/couch seating for all that want it. They also have a computer for you to use/email on, and a phone to call a cab with if you need to.

We went to this dealer on Saturday, March 29, 2014 and when we first got there everything was great - the sales people were nice and we didn't feel pressured to buy a car.  Efran was assigned to us as our sales person and he took the time to show us all the cars and answered all of our questions.  

We walked back inside and passed a Honda Civic EX-L... exactly what we wanted.  It had the leather, the navigation... the works!  It was beautiful!  Efran moved it out so that we could test drive it.  The ONLY thing we didn't like about this particular car was it's color - it was Kona Coffee color.  The inventory manager came out and asked us what color we did want and we wanted black with black interior, just like the one we were in only black.  We went on a test drive and when we came back they told us they found the one we wanted in Peoria, AZ from Arrowhead Honda.  They could get it into us by Tuesday.  

We went inside and agreed on a deal... we went into the finance guy and signed the paperwork for the car that we were going to get... or at least that is what we thought.  They said that was the paperwork for the ACTUAL car we were getting and we needed to fill it out now so that they could get the transfer of ownership started and when it came in all we had to do was come in and get the keys.  

On Monday morning we received a call that our car at Arrowhead Honda was broken into and that there was no other one available except for different color options, which we did not want.  So, we were told we had to wait for another one to be specially made.  

A month went by and we were getting very frustrated - no one called to give us updates.  My husband had to call or go there to get any kind of answers.  We searched online to see if there was one available at another dealer out of curiosity and we found TWO at Arrowhead Honda.  My husband called up there and they said that since that model is so rare that they do not share them.  Huh?!  But they were before, why not now?  My husband called SS Honda and they said they couldn't do anything.  

Our next step was to call Honda Corporate - they said they would look into it and get back to us in a few days.  While my husband was on the phone with them he had the paperwork and realized that we signed for the Kona Coffee color one!!  They gave us phony paperwork... which made us realize there was NEVER another car at Arrowhead Honda.  

Long story short... sort of... Honda didn't do anything for us nor did SS Honda.  When we went to sign for the new car the finance guy told us that it is common practice to just have ""placeholder"" paperwork until they get the actual car.  Why on earth would they do that?!  What a waste of time!  Even while we were doing the paperwork for the wrong car we were told it was for the car we were getting.  The whole thing just didn't make sense.  If it's just to hold whatever it was that we were holding, why not just tell us the truth?  I mean, when we signed it the finance guy was so concerned that everything was right including the mileage on the car that was coming from Arrowhead, if it wasn't the right car to begin with what does it matter?  Just tell us we need to sign something for the trade in, interest rate... etc., don't lie and tell us everything is done when we will have to do it all over again.

This place will do anything to sell you a car... whether they have it or not.  They take your trade in so you can't do anything about it later and you're stuck.  

We do have a beautiful car now but we had to go through absolute chaos to get it.  We were lied to and betrayed... we will do everything to stop business from going to this dealer.  We waited over a month and finally got it on May 4 - and all the paperwork we signed said May 1, so when did they really get it?!?

Please do not go here, you'll save yourself a lot of time and headaches.",2,_teS1bdWRd6csli1lA41Qg

I had made the reservation a week and a half prior to the day of the party. I called the establishment an hour and a half before the time of the party to double check about a few details. The representative from Flip Dunk informed me that my party started at 4p, not 6p. Obviously I felt terrible that this happened to my son when he was so excited. However, Flip Dunk didn't share my disappointment. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, the representative informed me that I would be able to receive passes to attend another day. So, I pulled it together and took all the kids to the movies to celebrate and informed all of the parents we would be returning to FD at a later date to jump. Did I say I prepaid nearly two hundred dollars? Or that I never received a courtesy conformation call from FD? Or that I was never sent the waiver for children's parents to sign who would be attending the party? So here I am, returning to FD to make up the mistake to my son and his friends. First thing they say is, does everyone have a waiver signed. I flip out, hehe!! but somehow every kid I brought had a waiver on file or their parent was still at FD to sign so their child could participate. Phew! I hadn't expressed my disappointment to the establishment until a child showed up about 30 minutes late. I was using one of the passes that was given to me and this lady (Mallory) steps in and says, is she your child? I said no. Then she said, ""these passes are for family members only"". I then told her, ""no, they are for my sons missed birthday party due to a miscommunication. And I also told her, ""no one confirmed with me about the details nor sent the waiver to be signed by every child's patent prior to the party"". Then Mallory said, ""we don't do that!"" I told her, yeah, because I prepaid, so why would you care about my sons birthday party? You already got your money, of course you don't care.

k2Zr99LMNhkKWgJrTcWFpg,0,2014-09-13 05:00:10,0,yfpK_fmSQFEAcs8MNn6Fbw,"This place is a complete SCAM! I had many IPL, BBL and laser heir removal treatments over the years, and my last BBL treatment was 5 weeks ago in accredited NYC place done by professional medical staff. I book an appointment with NLI for IPL(BBL) photofacial and laser hair removal in NY(at the crowne plaza at 66 Hale Avenue White Plains, NY 10601),  but something unusual happened, I was not a good candidate for IPL(BBL photo facial) and laser hair removal treatment at NLI !? I was shocked and still I am. 
At first, I was interested for  MicroLaserPeel or fractional l. treatment but as NLI did not planed to do it in NY they offered me eMatrix for 200$ but when I called to  book appointment they said they are charging 50$ (not 200$ ) and they are already booked, but if anyone cancel treatment they will call me, and  offered me IPL photofacial and laser hair removal and I did booked these 2 treatments, but little after me my friend called to make an appointment for same treatments and they offered  eMatrix for"" free"" as someone cancelled treatment, but my friend knew how much I wanted to do this treatment and ask me to come with her for a reason that she might not be a good candidate for eMatrix, and I did,  I went with her a day before my appointment, and we both filled out application and she get eMatix treatment.
 I was extremely disgusted what happened here today. I arrived 30min earlier, after taking subway, metro-north railroad train and cab which took me 2.5hr to get here, and then waited 40 min. to be seen, and finally when instructor for  hair removal t. came to me, she ask me about vitiligo which I have on 2 very small area on my skin, and then called me to come with her in a room where were students and where treatment should be performed, BUT instead of treatment I get used as vitiligo example, really, is that why I came here,  disgusting. After that very unpleasant experience, I ask front staff why they did not tell me to not come, why they did schedule my appointment, and why to share my vitiligo story with students if I am not getting treated. Soon, after I ask front staff will I get IPL treatment, came IPL instructor, same story, I was in a room with students. Again, front staff, and again I ask why I came here, if you had in my application for 24hrs that I do have vitiligo, and she answer me because we give discount, but when I ask on what I get discount, she was changing story. So, if I get here to be introduced as vitiligo example, and to use me to show to students how vitiligo look like , NLI staff should ask me for permission which I would not approve it! Also to add, when I get into room instructor started to speak about vitiligo, but when I ask will I get treatment she continue to speak about vitiligo, then I showed it and everyone were so interested to see as it was the only reason why I am here, but in the end she  said that IPL can cause negative effects because of vitiligo, and when she finished her lesson about vitiligo without discussion I got refused for treatment. So, I had that long trip and wasting my time to serve class lesson.
 In the end I told to women which called herself manager that my expenses for coming here for two 2 days are about 100$ and that I needed to cancel important things to come there, and she answered me that she will speak with main manager but later to refund my expenses , because he is at the moment in airplane and she is not able to contact him, really!  Thank you NLI for this horrible experience.
Also, to add, as I saw that you should not be trusted, and I am contacting ABS15 about advertising scam company, as NLI took advantage of me to even call me 2 times after I filled application to ask me to come earlier next day for a reason to give me more treatments for laser hair removal, but I do not know real purpose of that call as in my application was vitiligo for which NLI staff refused to treat me with both laser treatments.",0,w9HNJVY7dz8wgtgwJ-_p5A

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,1,2015-10-29,1,Snkhdq9J3IVyUH-eDp1GMw,"I tend to avoid the big flashy restaurants... especially in the ones in the downtown core. Part of me is always leery. When your main clientele is tourists and the business crowd - simply by location alone - there is a good chance that the food is not necessarily up to par with the cost associated to the meal. Now, I am always willing to be proven wrong so when I had a chance to try Bier Markt for the first time recently, I went in with an open mind.

For the uninformed, Bier Markt is a Toronto chain of restaurants that came to Montreal and took over the old Queue de Cheval location in front of the Bell Centre. Bier Markt's claim to fame is the ridiculous amount of beers they have available - over 150 beers from 30 different countries. The selection is extremely varied and quite good. The beer menu is nicely elaborate. It does a great job of categorizing and describing each beer to help with selection. The prices vary widely though which is a bit strange. I also appreciated that the food menu provides recommendations with pairing for each dish. For a restaurant like this, that detail is essential and provides a nice way to try new beers.

Foodwise, the menu is a mixture of beer garden and classic bar/pub fare. My friends and I went for three starters initially. First up was the French onion soup au gratin with caramelized onions, house veal stock, toasted bread and Gruy√®re cheese. Personally I did not try it but the response from my friends was good - not great.

Next was the baked Brie with Granny Smith apples, lingonberry jam, roasted pecans, pickles and baguette crisps. The jam was nice but once again, overall the dish was good, not great. The portion size was only not that great considering its cost either.

The final entree was the baked crab dip - wild Canadian rock crab, white cheddar, cream cheese, Old Bay spices and toasted house flatbread. This was a more interesting and well done dish. Very creamy with nice pieces of meaty crab within. Main issue once again though was the size relative to the price. Very limited amount of flatbread and frankly, this appetizer was barely sufficient for me much less as a dish to share - which at its price point, it needs to be.

Prior to the description of the mains, I will just take a moment to discuss the service. Now, for the most part, I am pretty relaxed about service in general - I simply want timely, friendly with a good handle of the menu. However, there are a few things that are BIG no-nos for me. One of them is very simple - you should never serve the next course without clearing the table first. During our meal, not only was that done but that was after all the empty dishes were left in front of us for about 20 minutes before serving. On top of that, the waitresses serving our table had no clue who had which main so the second course became a awkward and complicated dance of simultaneously removing, moving temporary around and serving dishes. And then, the same thing was repeated at dessert time later on! With the number of waitresses working around us, these were big red flags about the quality of service.

Back to the food now. The first main was the Merchant burger - 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, smoked bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, ""Bier 58"" sauce, toasted bun with house frites. A good sized burger - a little overcooked for my liking but still flavourful. A solid burger but again for its price, more was hoped for.

I personally went with the Chicken ABT - fresh chargrilled chicken breast, avocado, crisp smoked bacon, vine-ripe tomato, shaved iceberg lettuce and honey Dijon aioli in a Portuguese roll served with fries. The sandwich was good but somehow left me underwhelmed and wishing I had ordering something else. Some extra aioli and avocado may have helped to provide more kick but otherwise I felt the sandwich lacked pop. The fries were nice and crisp at least - very classic bistro style.

The final main was the smoked pork back ribs which are spice-rubbed and smoked for 6 hours, served with a golden BBQ sauce, fries and a red cabbage & caraway slaw. The ribs were nice and tender but because the sauce needed to be added by the client, they were a little dry. The BBQ sauce was a necessity to add, not a choice.

The final dish we ordered was the waffle ice cream sandwich - house-baked chocolate waffles served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Best thing we had all night - creative, chocolatey and rich. Always nice to end a meal on a positive.

In the end, Bier Markt left me cold. The beer selection was nice and varied - definitely the draw to coming back. However, the food was uninspiring and simply okay. The service was poor. Okay food can be acceptable at certain times but not when my personal bill was 80$ without tip. At that price, there are a heck of a lot better options I can enjoy. Bier Markt is a great happy hour spot for excellent beer but not a worthwhile dining option.

Cheers!",1,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw

As I was not happy with my massage I only left $10 which, in my opinion, is already a hefty tip for something I didn't enjoy. Then i was already leaving and the receptionists stops us and lectures us why we should tip more. That was extremely EMBARRASSING as the lobby was full of people staring at us. I gave an extra $5 and the therapist grunted and snatched it away from me (without exaggeration). They were nice in the beginning but show their RUDE side if you don't tip 40% or more. They even have huge lighted signs around the building telling you how much they should be tipped. I thought that was a little too much. 

I went in for the full body massage. It started okay then ended really rough. Walking on backs is not a new massage technique but this was not done well at all. This was not the first time I had this done on me either. It was too rough, too much pressure, and extremely uncomfortable. I did let the massage therapist know that it was hurting but he only stepped slower. I notified them a SECOND time and there was no change at all. 

The hot rocks BURNED my back. They never did a temperature test. I told him it was too hot and he only took it off for a few seconds and continued with the burn.  I have had hot rock massages before and this was the worst one I've ever experienced.",6,jAZPalUlfOWAQClasFvUDA

Scott is, so far, the best I've encountered. Do NOT go to Scott if you want to lay on a table and get rubbed for a while. It's not about relaxation. Your body is your temple and all that, but it's also a machine, and if the pulleys and levers are out of place/sync/whack, then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya. Just like how you gotta work out to get stronger, you gotta work on your injuries to make them better.

I spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing. The rest of my life is spent behind a computer, seated, in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms, upper arms, chest, and back. Add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis (or -osis, whatever), a hectic schedule living on the road, and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobility.

I keep most of this crap at bay with self-therapy, but that only goes so far. It feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor, when really, it needs a mop.

Scott is that mop.

In 90 minutes, he took my forearm extensors to the bone, gave 'em some active release....from typing, my pronators are as taut as a piano string. He isolated those bastards and gave 'em what for. The back, neck, and shoulder work was incredible, as I could open my chest afterward...which is rare for those of us with hypertrophied backs who rarely use our pushing muscles.

Appetizer- lobster bisque- it was alright, not really flavourful, just as Nicole mention below the lobster bisque was full of small cracked shells and I kept having to spit it out. 

Main - lobster linguine - omg was SO disappointed! The linguine had absolutely NO TASTE to it at all despite the waiter adding peppers and cheese to it. I had to put in some tobasco to make it some what edible  lobster tail itself was alright, nothing too special about it but I wouldn't order it again. 

Dessert- creme br√ªl√©e - the best plate of the night yet it's still not THAT great.

I believe this process took 2 hours on a holiday weekend.

The food overall was just about the same since last time although they didn't have black chicken soup that enjoyed last time. I recommend trying the various juices such as pineapple, strawberry, and hibiscus. There juices were natural light, refreshing, and not too sweet. One item I really enjoyed was the miso sea bass in the seafood section. It was hot, flaky, and deliciously full of flavor. I actually went back immediately for another portion. Another item I liked was in the dessert section; a light fluffy tropical cake was one my favorite dessert. I recommend drinking tea with this dessert.

This spot has quickly become a favorite of mine and as reluctant as I am to share with the masses, it deserves to be enjoyed by many. And let's be real, I need this place to thrive so I have a place to go on my afternoons. I'll cut to the goodies you want (why we all yelp in the first place...) 
Reasons why I love this place: 
- Consistent and attentive (without bugging) service. From my very first visit, I was treated like a friend coming over for a drink. I feel comfortable coming here alone to work and study and never feel rushed. Food comes up quickly and thus far, I've never had something I didn't like and never had an order arrive wrong. 
- EXCELLENT FOOD AND COCKTAILS! Seriously. Try the Roro burger or fish tacos. TBH, everything is delicious AF. Can't go wrong. Sauces are flavor-packed, food is cooked to order, and is plated (or basketed?) with care. It's in the little details here and they've impressed me with their attention to them. 
- A REAL Happy hour. None of that ""we just have a drink special or $1 off wells/ tap/ etc."" They do half off all alcoholic beverages including ALL of their lovely cocktails! I've always been meh about Paloma's but this place has made me fall in love with them. Happy hour is from open to 6pm I believe. 
- The atmosphere. Interesting music, small business feel, beautiful patio, simple and cute plant-based centerpieces. If you sit at the bar (you may find me there) it feels like you have a coveted kitchen seat with prime access to the bartender.

The pros: clean, nice music playing, appointments and walk in. The cons: too close to other clients. There is nothing relaxing about listening to the woman next to me grunting for an hour. Lukewarm water in foot bath bucket.
They weren't afraid of temperature though- the bottom of my left foot was actually burned on a hot rock. She was also using a rock to pound on my calves and twice hit that little bone on the inside of my ankle. Ouch. Massage was too deep- uncomfortable and I left with pain. Some people may like this and I'm usually happy with moderate pressure but this was too much. I also sensed that the woman giving the massage lacked awareness of muscles and anatomical landmarks because the mark was missed pretty much the whole time. I was excited because this place is close to my work and $80 for 2 hours is dirt cheap, but I will not return",0,lT2h25ZSr4c-Z9w9UODIgQ

I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised.

 Anywhere that you can enjoy animals in their own natural surrounding, I am an instant fan. I got to get up real close to some Canadian Geese grazing on the grass with their little ones and we also walked along the lake and saw a family of Mallard Ducks, what looked like a Sandpiper, and a Moorhen species. It is totally therapeutic and very enjoyable doing so, but I have a big concern that irritates the F out of me!!!

Hopefully The City of Henderson Parks and Recreation   will enforce a rule that prohibits anyone from feeding the wildlife. If you've been to Hemenway Park in Boulder City, Big Horn Sheep come down during the hot summer  months  from the hillside to graze. You are allowed to see/watch them, but you aren't allowed to feed or come in contact  with the sheep at any time or face a stiff fine. I strongly feel that the waterfowl that frequent Cornerstone Park should have the same respect! 

By feeding the wildlife, you are disrupting their way of life finding food for themselves. Observing them at close range when we first got there, all the geese were just fine grazing on the grass, bugs, and other insects. The ducks, moorhen, and sandpiper were seen also fending for themselves with insects and small fish in the lake/marsh area. They DO NOT need to be fed any type of human food, and  by doing so, you are only letting them get  accustomed to "" human handouts"" also contributing to future health issues, and even affecting their migratory  process over the years. These creatures will also lose their fear of humans and become very aggressive. If you've been to Haunauma Bay on Oahu back in the day  and tried to feed the fish while snorkeling  you know what I'm talking about. (They have banned the feeding of fish for some time now)

During our last  few minutes at the park, I saw a family with a bag of  hot dog  buns heading towards the lake, and this other guy scatter a bag of popcorn all over the grass causing the geese to get aggressive with each other. Totally different scenario from when we first saw them. If no such rule gets enforced, it'll become a mess like Sunset  Park and Aliante Nature Discovery Park  is. Have fun, bring  the family, respect the surroundings , and feed your face if you need to...NOT THE WILDLIFE!!!! ALOHA!!!

I took my 4runner in for a minor maintenance service. The kind where they claim to also do a complimentary 30 point inspection. And here is the problem: I had my truck at the Toyota of Lake Norman about 3 months prior and they did the same 30 point inspection as well and noted my battery was bad (red status), replace very soon & the service manager told me the same; that I should not wait long before replacing. 

Well Toyota of Town & Country is closer for me so I decided to take it in there. I did not tell them about the battery, I thought I'd let them find it on their own. Well when the service manager called me to let me know what the costs would be for the service I primarily took it there for (brakes), I asked if they found anything else. He told me no - and I suggested they recheck the battery; he raved that he had his best Tech on the job, but would ask him to check again just the same. 

The service manage called me back and sure enough my battery needed replacing. Here is why I am writing this negative review: the battery check is on the 30 point inspection, there are 3 status scores to the inspection - initially Town & Country listed my battery as green status (good), but when I challenged them, they rechecked (??????!!!!!) the battery and then gave it a red status. The battery status is not a visual check, how do you get that wrong??? My thought is that they didn't even bother to check the first go-round - which makes me very concerned about the quality of the additional work they did!!!!! I would suggest you call around for prices first because Town & Country is expensive, and you don't even know if they are doing quality work.",14,6au-XoKYas6YIRLDq8Klbg

This place does not know how to manage time or appointments, and the customer service is impeccable. I scheduled a 12:30pm appointment for a gel manicure so I could run over on my lunch since my office is within walking distance. I was traveling out of town after work and did not have time to visit my regular nail salon so I figured I would give this place a chance.

I walked in 10 minutes early to find that there were only three people working. There were also three of us waiting, two of which seemed to have been waiting a long time by the time I walked in. After sitting there for 40 minutes, other people who walked in after all of us waiting were taken in before me, despite me having an appointment, and the others waiting. Once all three workers finished their clients, and took on new clients, I knew I would be in for an even longer wait, so I walked out. 

Never once did they acknowledge me, the fact that I scheduled an appointment, or that I had been waiting for over 40 minutes on my lunch break. When I told them to cancel my appointment because I could not wait any longer, they acted as if they had no clue what I was talking about and never once apologize.

But, my friend insisted it was a cool-looking spot and had tasty food, including veggie options, so I gave the Arcadia neighborhood restaurant a whirl and was pleased with my meal there.

Upon walking in, I was immediately impressed by the long, dark bar lit up by red lights. There's no host, but a bartender will direct you where to sit-at the bar, or in one of the comfy booths facing the bar. The restaurant is one long rectangle, which makes every seat in the house an intimate one because you don't have to hear chatter from other parties. The bar features sports televisions, and it's a hip place for casual occasions.

The menu, not surprisingly, is full of meat dishes, including hamburgers, a chicken wrap and a turkey burger. I opted for the grilled portobello sandwich ($10), which came with fried zucchini, ricotta salata and watercress. It was a massive burger and tasted great.

I added a side of mac and cheese ($6), which also tasted great but wasn't anything spectacular.


My pal got the equally massive peppercorn burger ($10), topped with charred onion, watercress and matchstick potatoes.

I shared his tasty fries ($4) with him.

While I thought The Grind was a little pricy, especially because burgers don't come with sides and my meal totaled $16, I think the atmosphere is sleek and trendy and worth it if you really want a nice burger place.

I been wanting to try it for a while now and I did today their food is good it has flavor although that spicy mayo they put on everything and it over whelms their dish. Don't get me wrong it's good it's not bad but I had way to much of it on the steak breakfast taco which made me not taste so much of the rest and also my steak on the taco was good however it was over cooked. . Croquetas are not bad but they're super small. Size of a quarter . Staff IS super friendly so that helps them a lot. I think maybe if they came up with another sauce for their dishes they'll have a better outcome . I also tried their empanada. Not bad but then again they serve it with that spicy mayo dip which quite frankly I don't think it goes with the empanada. Now, I will come back and give them a second chance and try another item on their menu. Their food has flavor .",0,Q_m37d9pZnP7y3T0gla6NQ

I ate it with everything except the sour cream, however I did slice up some cheddar cheese and added ketchup. A bit spicy in some bits, but over all- finger licking good. 

Next to review the cupcake sampler. First up was the vanilla bean cupcake- good. Icing tastes just like vanilla bean ice cream, but the actual cupcake is just ok/mediocre. Next up was the chocolate one- omg death by chocolate.. dark chocolate, very rich and bitter, should be served with ice cream. Third, the lemon drop- by far my absolute favorite. If they didn't have the rule of ""no mixing and matching"".. I'd probably order all 4 lemon drop cupcakes! Absolutely yummy! Lastly, I enjoyed red velvet- it wasn't horrible, but after lemon drop, it wasn't very memorable. It had more of a Graham cracker pie crust kind of flavoring than of red velvet.  I would be interested to see them make a German chocolate cupcake with the coconut and nut filings! :-)

Over all 3 to 3.5 stars.",0,Gb9Y_f1xslY1mDvvHBXaLg

However, living in Las Vegas for almost 10 years, I'd always wanted to see these guys live.  Hearing about them around the time I was in junior high school, their brand of magic got my attention right away.  This is not just simply watch closely and be amazed with what I can do with my hands type of artistry, this is completely different.

Certain tricks do involve slight of hand yes, but other tricks, some of them you'll be scratching your head for days wondering ""how'd they do that???""  I got tickets for my fianc√©e's birthday last January and we got seats towards the far right side of the audience about 5-8 rows away from the stage which still offers a great view. However, this is the reason why this show loses a star.

The seating...is not the most comfortable.  I think they are hoping for people that are not particularly wide in nature to sit in this theater because they have a thick armrest with a metallic base between each seat that is IMMOBILE.  That's right, you cannot, no matter how hard you try, lift or remove the arm rests between the seats.  This caused a lot of discomfort for my fianc√©e and I because it was difficult to sit in one position for more than 10-20 minutes and we couldn't hold each others hands very easily.  Also, there's no place to put your jacket if you come in with one unless you stuff it under your seat, and that may be fine for some, but I for one hate throwing my jacket on the floor of anyplace and stuffing it under my seat in hopes that I will still find it there when I leave as well as find that nothing's been stolen from it so we basically just had to hold our jackets in our laps the whole time.  Really hope they do a remodel of their seating for the future.

So, the show itself, is a combination of illusion and stand up comedy.  Penn is a very outspoken man.  That's nothing new.  He spoke a lot about the TSA and laws and human rights and went so far as to produce his own miniature metallic copy of the Bill Of Rights and of course gave everyone notice that the item was available for purchase when they leave the show.  I got a bit of a George Carlin vibe from Penn in fact.

Teller of course just has to appear and pull some interesting facial expressions and you get a great laugh.  He also has tons of funny items he'll pull out of his pockets.  His shtick reminded me a lot of Harpo Marx.

The crowd involvement was a nice touch, few magicians allow more than 4-5 people to come up on stage to volunteer during their shows, but Penn and Teller allowed practically 5 rows of people to come up on the stage to watch them make a cow disappear!  Also, before the show, you're invited to come up on stage and sign an envelope as part of a trick involving prediction of what someone is reading.

The other thing that I would recommend to people going to the show is to actually be prepared to potentially BE involved! This is a show! It's supposed to be fun! The gentleman they had come up on stage for the part of the envelope trick had absolutely no emotion.  He spoke in a very monotone voice and had a way about him like ""Oh yeah, I'm up on stage with Penn and Teller...it's getting late...I hope I can still manage to have sex with my wife while I'm still in Las Vegas and take advantage of that all you can eat prime rib for $9.99...""

Again, it's a SHOW! You're here to see a show!  Have fun! Look at what's happening up on stage! You're going to be amazed at what you see! If you're just going to see a trick and then say to yourself, ""Oh yeah, I know how that's done..."" or ""I gotta look that up online when I get home so I can figure out how they did it and post it to my Facebook page to spoil it and say ""You'll NEVER have to go see Penn and Teller after watching this video!"""" then you're in the wrong place Mister.

I really enjoyed getting a chance to take a photo with Penn after the show.  I'd seen him before many times being a local here in Las Vegas.  From a local movie theater, to the AVN show, to just a random spotting at the Venetian.  My fianc√©e also told him how much we enjoyed seeing his appearance on an episode of Modern Family.  

Again, Penn and Teller are not for everyone, but if you say to yourself ""Hey, they've been playing in Las Vegas for a while now, maybe I should check them out..."" you may just be surprised at what you'll see!

Remember, the acts that are still playing in Las Vegas for over 10 years, are usually still here for a REASON, and it's because they are GOOD!",1,m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw

This is a nice little casual spot in. High end casino. They specialize in craft burgers here and it really shows in their breakfast sandwich!",2,GBqCVQup28CA4pUlZOFLJQ

The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.  But there were a few things that bothered me about our meal. First the service, our server was very nice and professional. I just wish he was a little more tentative to our table. I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink. 
Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great. And i feel that when you go to a high end steakhouse house everything should be great.  That's why you pay $15 cocktails and $60 steaks...",2,x8e1Cc1lh835Q1CpHAD0RQ

The deal was buy one get one so we stepped inside.  The atmosphere inside is upscale and cool.  It is a small place so there is no room for a dance floor.  That can be an upside though.  You can actually sit down and have a conversation.

It was heavily staffed so we had no problem getting consistent service.  Some of the staff were clearly still learning, but overall the service was fine.

The menus are on Ipads.  It allows you to scroll through the different drink categories and get additional info on the items you want to know more about.  The prices are in line with most of the nicer places in Las Vegas.

Overall I think this is a solid place to grab a drink away from the crowds.  The decor is nice, but I could not figure out how it all fits together.  My biggest concern is the location.  I am not sure they can get enough people coming in to survive.",2,3wB-JjsUjkvdNUDRnChsVg

This is my second time at Caesars and the first time for dinner. The first thing we noticed was that my girlfriend who is vegetarian didn't have many options at all - we've come to assume that Vegas buffers are good for vegetarians but this definitely was not the case. And even though I eat meat, I don't really eat seafood so a lot of the options were ruled out for me too. It seemed to us that most ppls meals revolves around seafood and that seemed to be the highlight of the buffet. 

Apart from the lack of food options, we were extremely disappointed with the service at the counters - there seemed to be no one around to help answer our questions, the dishes were mislabeled quite a few times, and the Choco lava cake that I got was mediocre at best. 

Nevertheless we had enough food to stuff ourselves with, and coupled with the bottomless mimosa package that we got, made up for some of the experience.",0,nsdZCXZZfvmOataVhoQgsQ

AMBIANCE
+ Tucked away on quiet Wellington, Le Select looks rather modest from afar but as you edge closer, you're greeted by a wonderfully open patio space with happy people chatting away over scrumptious-looking dishes. Step through the doors and you're welcomed by a beautifully quaint interior. Lovely!
+ Feel free to dress up or down - totally up to you

SERVICE
Note: Bustling place! Definitely a regular spot for many. 
+ Servers are sufficiently attentive with water/coffee refills. 
+ Despite the busyness, the hostess was very accommodating to the change of our party size (3 to 4). Though waters were already set down, they changed us to a cozy corner without a fuss. 
+/- I forgot to switch out the fries for salad and although I was lightly chastised (lol), the server allotted my desired salad 

FOOD [Brunch review! $27 incl tax and tip  steak tartare + croissant]
+ Complimentary starter: DELICIOUS butter, delightfully creamy in a subtle manner. Pairs nicely with the bread.
+/- Beef Tartare: I enjoyed this with the pepper on the table. This is supposedly best in the city (thanks, Yelpers!) but was not to my fancy. I do confess that I'm not much of a beef tartare person to begin with though. 
+/- Braised Brisket Brioche Sandwich: I sampled this and it was VERY flavourful. If you're a hungry, savoury bruncher - this might be it. Brisket literally melted in my mouth.. UNF. This is accompanied by vegetable chips (similar to the black bags you get at Porter)- yum! Personally, I wouldn't have been able to eat the entire sandwich though, a bit too overpowering for my palate.
- Pass on the Rahier croissant - it isn't anything special but if you must, ask for jam (no extra cost)! The jam was good!! 

Overall: I'd be down to come back here to try their sweet brunch foods.

NEVER AGAIN and I hope you do not make the mistake of EVER coming here.  They chipped the original paint on my 71 Ford f-100 ranger and They were trying to to make it seem like it was not big deal after they tried to totally deny it.  The scratch looked fresh.  My car isn't perfect but this scratch was on the driver side where i climb in every day and if I see a scratch on my baby do you think I would not notice it especially after I just climber out of it to get it washed and saw no scratch on the side? They then had me contact the manager who i tried calling on different days of the week twice and he only returned my call once only to say he would get back to me and then I never heard from him again.  I then tried to stop by and redeem coupons that were given to me out of pity from the front cashier out of pity because she felt bad I got burned so bad.  They flat out told me I was not allowed to have my car washed here any more.  I told them I did not attempt to get anyone fired or prolong the conflict.  I never got any payment or compensation for the incident but only wanted to get my dirty truck cleaned and make sure it did not happen again.  They kept telling me no and that's where I lost my patience and told the guy I won't be denied by a place that messed up my trucks original paint and gave them the courtesy of not escalating it.  I was pissed and told the guy he was a F-head get your manager or I'm calling the better business bureau on the grounds of improper discrimination. They said they'd talk with the manager and came back telling me they would let me wash my car here but only a hand wash which was ten to 15 dollars more.  I replied no unless you are giving it to me for the price I would pay to get it washed through the machine.  They said no we don't want the same thing happening as last time so you will have to pay the extra money or get the F out of here.  I told them especially after the embarrassment and feeling of prejudice against me There was no way I would pay extra money for their problem.   I asked if they were willing to accepted the coupons I was given last time as a token of their apology for my chipped paint on behalf of the cashier who knew I got burned and knew they handled the problem very ineffectively and in many ways offensive.  They would not accept them because they said they only accept them on Thursdays and I asked if they could call the manager again to see if they will make an exception.  They were unwilling to take the effort so i flipped them off reversed out of their lot screeching my tires and I personally am never coming back.  This is the worst business I have ever witnessed and if you want to keep your car nice, feel like you matter and that you are respected on a business to consumer level do not do business with these morons.  This is not a biased review.  This is 100% word for word a normal review of my account and I need to put this out there so I can save you all from the pain and embarrassment this crooked, unprofessional and in some ways illegal actions this so called business brought to my pride and joy not just my truck but my actual pride and joy.

The mug is huge and it's served very hot, which is a rare treat.  I also appreciate that they don't load it with whipped cream and other toppings.  It's just a straight up mocha, no dressing required.  You can tell it's decadent and yet I don't think it would be too sweet for most people.  

I was impressed with the menu items and even though I'd consider most of them to be a bit expensive, they appear enticing enough to make the prices seem worth it.  I didn't have enough of an appetite to test this theory, so I just tried a Turkey Sausage Roll.  It was sizable and surprisingly flavorful.  

It was very busy during the lunch hour.  I wasn't a fan of the extreme noise level (the acoustics are terrible) and the large tables.  These two factors combined made visiting a little strenuous.  I do love the large windows and natural light, though.

I ordered one of the company's much talked about photo books shortly after Christmas. I uploaded the photos from my phone via the Shutterfly app and after filling out the billing and shipping info, I know that I had probably only spent a handful of minutes designing the look and feel of my book. Seriously, my part was done and over with after maybe four minutes and then I called it a day. I didn't put much effort forth in creating my ""masterpiece,"" so I didn't know what to expect. I'd never used Shutterfly before this, but the process seemed pretty quick and painless, not to mention fairly inexpensive, so I was down for it. After all, I didn't spend hours copiously designing fancy borders and all for my book, so maybe my expectations were not ridiculously high.

I received my book in the mail before the estimated ship date, which meant the turnaround was  about 8-9 days. I thought that post-Christmas, the timing seemed pretty reasonable.  Overall, I was pleased with the majority of the book. The cover looked great and most of the pictures came out quite well. However, two of the photos that I uploaded from my Iphone that looked exquisite as they were didn't come out so well. For some reason, they were not cropped appropriately or anything. It's like they just cut off at the bottom. I don't understand it and I was rather looking forward to seeing those two photos in my photo book as they appeared in their original form, but unfortunately, the shots (which were selfies) don't look like they do on my phone or on FB or Instagram, where I also uploaded them.

I'm disappointed by that and had no idea that they would turn out like that. Did I need to crop them myself or was that the fault of Shutterfly? I truly don't know, but either way, I don't see why the perfectly gorgeous photos were laid out as they were on the pages when they don't look like that in my phone or when I printed them from FB. Weird.

The rest of the photos looked high quality and the pages were laid out in the order in which the pics were uploaded to the app. I was pleased with the rest of the book, the cover came out just as I hoped it would and the overall price of the book wasn't bad (retails for $29.99 and up), especially with the first time user discount applied to it. Still, those two shots that were haphazardly chopped off do stick out like a sore thumb. 

One odd thing that I noticed, though? The photo book pages have a rather distinctive, fairly strong smell to them that I hope will dissipate with time. 

Will I use the Shutterfly app/website to order more products in the future? I'm willing to give them another try. I still like the overall product and the process is as easy as can be. I'm a busy girl, so something that is that user-friendly always gets points with me.",13,ZPGGhPerGYby3RARwRsRUw

I didn't find any of that, at least on the items that I wanted to purchase.  With the addition of the crazy long lines, I just couldn't justify shopping here today.  

As someone who shops regularly at Mekong Plaza and Lee Lee Market, I felt like I was still shopping in those places, except this store is a bit bigger and the aisles wider.  Unfortunately bigger, wider aisles didn't really help much on a day as busy as this one.  Also, I was expecting the selection to be a little more ""international"" and not just mainly Asian, but I should've known better.

I've had a multitude of mixed experiences here, both in service and food quality. When the baked goods are fresh, some of them can be outstanding. But when they've dried and/or gone stale and they're still selling them, it's like throwing money in the trash. (And sometimes when you ask what's fresh and you get it, it's still sub par.) The bread leaves something to be desired--I do not go here for their bread items.

Pekara is not an inexpensive place to eat, either. Sometimes the service is fast and friendly and other times it's indifferent and slow. While most local businesses have a policy for a minimum spending amount to use a debit/credit card, most shop owners will still let you use your card if you're out of cash and making a purchase. Not here. I was thirty cents below the minimum and had no other means of paying for my purchase and I did not want to add on another $3 item, so the cashier took my item back and I walked out the door. It just baffles me that they'd rather lose a sale/customer than let you use your card for a $2.20 purchase.

The service at the tables isn't so great either (obnoxious, pretentious, not service-oriented).  However, the non-burger dishes here are quite good, in particular, the mac n cheese and their milkshakes.

Their burgers, I'd give a 3.5/5, but their PULLED PORK MAC N CHEESE, I give a 5/5.  Skip the burgers altogether and order the aforementioned mac n cheese (with crumbled potato chips infused with truffle oil), get a small side of the truffle fries, and make SURE to get their tall and delicious Bailey's milkshake, and I swear, you'll be on cloud number 9!  

If you have room, try the giant chocolate-chip cookie a la mode.  Had it twice, and I have to say, the second time, the cookie was over-cooked, so the best bet is to fill up on the mac n cheese and treat their gigantic milkshake as your dessert.

I suppose I ought to comment on the burgers, since it is a burger place.  There's great selection, good ingredients and an impressive variety of chi-chi toppings, if that's your thing.  Now, I don't mind forking over money for a great meal, in fact, I'm happy to do so, however, that's only for a really good meal.

You can't really complain because the shops at Pacific Mall are made of glass walls.

The procedure itself was pretty standard. She chose her jewellery, got marked and then got pierced. Everything was very clean and sterile, so no complaints! We were then instructed on how to clean the piercing. The whole process took less than 15 minutes and was $60.",1,h-7Q81VjaXYyejjFTNcIsQ

The mechanic was totaly incompetant. mechanic had to disconnect transmission cooler lines, but could not figure out how to refill transmission fluid, or check it. mechanic said it is ok to lose transmission fluid. (about a quart was spilled on floor.)Mechanic installed wrong coolant. I insisted they install dexcool, as per mfr's strict guidelines.  After getting car home, i inspected for leaks, and found that several coolant hose clamps were not tightened at all, airflow baffles were not re-installed but were in the front bumper, fan shroud retaining parts were not installed, air cleaner not installed right, and a 103 dollar plastic air filter retaining clamp was broken in half. 
   I also discovered that transmission cooler lines were now leaking at the radiator connection. (not installed correctly.) When mechanic installed the correct coolant, he mixed it himself with 50% tap water. Now I need to flush the sytem myself, and install a premixed 50/50 dexcool mixture of coolant, or risk engine damage.

The ambience was exactly what we needed on a serene summer day and the food was good enough, but in the context of Montreal it was just ok. 
 
Boris Bistro is located on Rue McGill and hosts an outdoor terrace that transports you to a secret garden in the middle of a bustling city. This earns them 4, maybe 5 stars as it is the perfect respite for a relaxing lunch, brunch, or dinner.

The menu holds its own in a city like Montreal with offerings such as bison tartare, lamb shank and duck confit sandwich just to name a few. The drinks were solid and they have happy hour specials on the beer (it leaves much to be desired but at least they offer something).  I tried their sangria which was good, my friend had one of their cider beers (she seemed less than amused), and the boys got a sparkling red wine which was delicious. They score a 3/4 on drinks. 

My party started out with the charcuterie plate which disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. It was a tough call for me between the duck sandwich, the risotto, and the fish offering (I forget what it was), but I'm a sucker for duck (done right) so I went with that.  I have to say, I don't think I've experienced duck quite like that before. I imagined something shredded, succulent and flavorful in between 2 pieces of bread... at least it was shredded.   It wasn't a bad experience, it was just different. The duck was served almost in a waldorf chicken salad style over sprouts in between 2 slices of a nut bread.  It was enormous with a more than generous amount of duck. The combination worked, especially the nut bread...I just wasn't what I expected so I was slightly disappointed.  I wouldn't get it again, just from personal preference. 

My friend ordered the lamb shank, and lets just say the next thing we knew all that was left was a bare bone, so I guess that was good! The other 2 ordered the bison tartare which they said was good but I didn't get an ""out of this world"" vibe from them. The food is a 3-4.

In a different city, this may earn a much higher rating but with so many other options in Montreal, the main reason to come here is their cozy outdoor terrace on a beautiful summer day (maybe for drinks and apps).",4,nkX9riHbrASlZcTfnAMGiw

Well, the GTA.

The Montreal Deli is just west of the 427 and has plenty of parking. That I'm leading with it being conveniently located just beyond an overpass and raving about the parking might not bode well. But it's not that bad.

Smoked meat in Toronto (or Mississauga) is what it is. Depending on your Clintonian definition of what ""is"" is, Montreal Deli is doing its best. Prices are reasonable. The super smoked meat plate (about $11.50) gives you a nice stack of meat, fully acceptable fries, slaw, and a kosher dill. If you think of this as anything *but* a simulacrum of the true Montreal smoked meat experience, well, it's pretty awesome all around.

For purists, I've included in the photo section a photo of the Montreal deli smoked meat super combo and the gold standard of smoked meat, Schwartz's. A keen observer will note the difference in consistency of the meat. The Montreal Deli serves it up almost like a thinly sliced ham. Schwartz's gives you thick rich slices of smoked meat ready to crumble and then melt in your mouth. [Oh god, 2.5 hours until lunch time. - your stomach butting in]

Susan C's better half quibbled with the bread and I defer to his judgment there. I was a suburban boy (a shout out to my homies in Dollard-des-Ormeaux!) Susan's better half is a McGill grad, hence a veteran of smoked meat and it probably goes without saying the Peel pub. From his lack of joyous weeping, I gather he was in the same opinion boat as I.

I'll say this, however, service is fast. I think we had our food in about five minutes. I've waited longer at McDonald's for a McFlurry. 

Bottom line: prices are great, service is fast and great, you get a lot of great food, it's still not real Montreal smoked meat, but give it a try.

(Those without access to a crap car, you can subway it to Kipling, I think jump on the West Mall bus, and then get off before it diverges off Dundas. It's not an unpleasant walk to the Montreal Deli.)",10,mb_8jXannipO5T5V5kGXiQ

The owner of YFCV was able to provide me with a truck and excellent employees on almost no notice. They were so exceptional that I booked them for my move from downtown Toronto to Caledon. It was a complicated move in that it required them to pick up items from my condo and two storage units then move it all out of the city to a farmhouse on a dirt road. They worked efficiently but very carefully. I've since used them twice for smaller projects. Each of their employees I've met has had a great attitude and is extremely careful both with my things and with my living spaces. I have never had better movers, including some of the large prestigious brands and can't recommend them highly enough. They are honest, quote accurately for the job, careful, and knowledgeable.

We had reservations around 7:45pm, the staff is extremely attentive and friendly. There is a yelp check in deal for a free glass of wine, I don't think anyone would mind that :) When we sat down they gave us chips & salsa, be warned the salsa had small jalape√±o's in it and for someone like me that does not eat spicy items I had to make sure to avoid it when I went in for the dip.  I'm a vegetarian so I loved that they had a special section dedicated for me, I hate skimming through options and liking what I read then I hit the meat ingredient and have to keep going. Nothing on the vegetarian section seemed appealing, so I asked the waiter if I could get a simple cheese enchilada with beans & rice on the side and they accommodated to my request. The enchilada was delicious, the tomato sauce had a hint of garlic which gave it a wonderful flavor. The beans were not to heavy and good and as for the rice it was white rice with some vegetables in it, went well with my enchilada. After our meal we got desert, they have several options a delicious churro being on of them haha but I picked the tres leeches cake.

The food: It was delicious with only one (tiny) issue. We had the tomato bread (because you have to) with the Ham Platter (Seleccion de embutidos) which included Iberico ham, Serrano and a spicy salami - which was amazeballs. Totally brought back memories of Barcelona tapas bars.

I also can't say enough about the 'Pimientos Rellenos de buey' (Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and Manchego cheese) - rich, decadent, delicious and perfectly paired with the wine we were drinking. The wine was from the Ribera Del Duero region, called 'Avaniel' - highly recommended.

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

I learned about chopines (essentially crazy-high platform shoes from the 16th century) and that there was a time when both men and women wore high heels. And I saw a GIANT cowboy boot and teeny tiny shoes from Coraline. I marvelled at Shaq's size 23 high top sneaker and Elton John's gayest of the gay footwear. I read A LOT about various kinds of women shoes and how they demonstrate femininity in various time periods and other parts of the world. (Maddening, yes. But also educational and you get to start to see trends).

Some of the exhibits were less interesting and less marvelous but I still dutifully read most of the little signs describing spiritual footwear and chestnut crushing boots. 

Don't go with someone who is easily bored, don't go when you yourself are feeling boring. Go when (or if) you thirst for random facts and trivia about footwear. 

I don't particularly like shoes (with the exception of colourful and comfortable sneakers) so I am proof that you don't have to love shoes to enjoy this place. Hell, maybe I enjoyed this place more because I don't like shoes (if you just want to see pretty shoes, this is not for you - there is actual history education happening in this museum!). 

All of the floors and exhibits were open when I was there, they seem to change occasionally and like any museum there will be times when some are closed. So call ahead or check the website if that sort of thing would bother you.

When to go? I would recommend going on Pay-What-You-Can Thursday nights. For those of you who dislike screaming children on field trips, there weren't any when I was there. And while I'm clearly a fan of this museum, I don't know if I would have felt I really got my moneys worth if I had paid $12. The $5 suggested donation felt just about right.

I was assured my insurance was accepted and they were a preferred provider. This was not the case. After the x-rays were taken the doctor suggested a full scaling as I hadn't see a dentist for a while. I figured I was already there so why not. The receptionist came in to tell me my insurance required a $50 deductible and I wouldn't be billed anything else. Maybe it was the friendly atmosphere. Or the fact I was already numbed up but I didn't put two and two together that my insurance only charges that deductible for non-preffered providers. So they were ""in network"" but they were not preferred as I was told they were. The office stuck to their word and didn't bill me for the extra my insurance didn't pay (almost three grand) . But the prices they charged my insurance company used up my whole years allotment for ONE visit..... A cleaning! What if I had an emergency? Or needed a tooth capped? I cringed at the thought of that bill. 

Do yourself and your wallet a favor and use the list your insurance says is in a preferred provider. They agree the accept a lower billing from the dentist in turn charging you less.
If this is on your list of preferred providers your in for a treat as this is a great office.",9,uC10HJmwtjitFGHgf2YRRg

Within approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.

They say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. 

The strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!

Most of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. 

Kick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.

I did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.

I did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!

I decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. 

I ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!

At the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!

I used them over 7 months on a 3 wk rotation. So this review is not based on 1 or 2 services. This is an observation over time. 
Sometimes they didn't show up on time (no big deal), no call no showed me twice and rarely sent 2 people (a very big deal). One housekeeper doing the work of 2, while you are paying for two is no good. In my opinion, the housekeeper is being overworked as Im sure the housekeeper is getting the same pay whether they have another set of hands or not. I did NOT like that. The work should be divided properly between 2 people. Like other companies. 
 
I hired another company (see my review) who ALWAYS send 2, they are cheaper, they clean the windows and blinds without charging ""extra"" and  have never ""no call no showed"" me. Both ladies are in and out in 1.5 hours TOPS with more completed.
Everytime Superb Maids no called no showed or couldn't send 2 people, I always got a bunch of excuses (Mostly using my square footage as an excuse to not consistently send 2) 
As a client it's no fun waiting 3- 4 hours at home on your day off to:
A) Have one maid show up to do the work of two which takes twice as long. (Basic things would get missed, like cleaning the floor around the toilet, top of the range and fridge, bathroom mirrors, etc.) I don't want to pay for a service, lose 4 hours of my day, so I can go over and clean missed things after she left. 
B) Wait at home for NO ONE to show up. (Also very frustrating).
The impression I got is, if you have a small house/condo, they arent really interested in your business and will skip you on your scheduled rotation for a bigger, more expensive, client.

I am surprised to see any negative reviews,  because our granite countertop project was flawless.  Our salesperson, Taylor, was fantastic: helpful, knowledgeable, and very professional.  She helped us find a stunning slab of granite, and we were able to choose how it would be cut for our two countertops.  By the way, they have a huge indoor area with more beautiful slabs of granite than you can imagine.  

The installers were perfectionists- they took great care not to leave so much as a scratch on any walls, and the precision of their work was better than we ever hoped for.  Our kitchen went from bland to looking like a million bucks!

Oh- and we had first checked at a big name home improvement store that had a ""20% Off"" sale on countertops & installation going on.  Design Mart still beat their price, and with a piece of granite that I'm sure was a higher grade than we'd have gotten elsewhere.  Cutomer service was courteous, efficient- Spot on!  

I guess that their expansion and the move to a new location some time ago, had caused some ""growing pains"" that affected some of their ratings.  However, we had no problems at all.

Just saw that they didn't pass their health inspection last month and I'm not in the least bit surprised.  I definitely won't be throwing any more money away at this establishment. Literally any other restaurant in Tempe Marketplace is an upgrade from the experience at this unsanitary burger joint. How do you ruin a burger that's usually so good?!

If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE!  For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera.  The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served.  Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entr√©e.  No one wants to eat their salad, while their entr√©e is getting cold.  Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals!  He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera.  It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing!  My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery.  All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed!  Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals.  We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake!  It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant.  We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections.  They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, cr√®me brulee, and cheesecake.  Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint.  Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant?

I come to Sakana on a semi-regular basis for lunch because it is rare that you can find a $10-12 sushi lunch that won't leave you disgusted or with stomach problems later. Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good. 

The fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.

Also try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.

If you're looking for gym, tan, laundry and fist pumping boys you're at the wrong show.  Just sayin. haha    I def. recommend JB if you're looking to be entertained by something other than a cirque, magic or boobie show.   

Tickets:  We ended up just purchasing our tix from the Paris desk since we were staying at the Paris.  Too lazy to go to discount tix or look for cheaper ones.  We got the cheapest tickets which were around 60 bucks.  FYI:  I heard the couple next to us ask if they had senior citizen discounts and they were hooked up.  Score!

Venue:  Any seat is good since it's not a huge venue.  There aren't any funky columns or obstructions anywhere so no chance of having to watch with your neck turned at a 90 deg angle.  We were sitting the 3rd or 4th row from the back and it was fine.  So unless you feel the need to be up close and personal you're fine getting the cheap seats.

Show:   I know I'm getting older when I want to hear music my 63 and 65 year old parents listen to!  Hubs and I were like one of the youngest couples there (in our 30s) but age is nothing but a numba here.  I won't go into details since you should see it for yourself but I will be honest, the beginning is kinda boring.  I remember whispering to the hubs it better pick up or I was ready to take a nappy nap.  But after 15-20 minutes it picks up.  JB is all about how Frankie became Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons via acting, dancing, and great singing.  I was actually surprised by how many of their hits I knew! So sit back, relax, and enjoy!

LFmH7oUMwxZV2KzcoRE2pQ,0,2014-07-30 13:49:36,0,xCV_PbAdHAsLET5dvqHY9Q,"Ok, so this place is a big box dental corporation. This is not your average individually owned/family owned dental practice. My first appointment I was told over the phone that they schedule two visits; one to clean your teeth and one for the X-rays/consultation. I'd never heard of that and thought it was odd and inconvenient, but agreed to go. Oddly,  they did all of it in the first appointment, so I'm not sure why I was initially told this. 

The dental hygienist starts off by telling me that because I was 2 months past due for my last 6 month cleaning that I ""probably had some form of gum disease/periodontal disease"" and I needed to ""prepare myself"" for that. This was before she'd taken one look in my mouth. She then pulls out a book filled with pictures of people with advanced gum and periodontal disease and makes me look at each picture. By this time I'm wondering what kind of dental office I'm in because NONE have ever done this and I know full well I have healthy gums. 

She then takes about 40 pictures of my teeth. I normally have bite wings done and every 5 years they'll do the full mouth X-ray, but I've never had actual camera type pictures taken. It took a good hour. 

Finally she starts the exam and unbelievably I have NO gum disease nor periodontal disease. In fact the dentist (when he finally appeared) said I have excellent gums and bones, which I already knew. 

The same hygienist then starts using high pressured sales techniques to get me to buy one of their electric toothbrushes. I told her I like the one I have and she made snide comments like,""well if don't want the best"" etc...She then informed me I'd be charged $80 for this visit. I have NEVER been charged for a 6 month cleaning/exam. I have insurance and it's free. She said I would be charged $56 for an oral cancer screening and $24 for fluoride. I declined both and that's when she got nasty. She kept trying to make me agree and I would not. I finally told her I forgot my checkbook and she said to me with a look of disgust,""oh so you didn't come prepared to your visit today."" I was so shocked by her comment that I just sat there speechless. 

Bottom line, if you need affordability for things like crowns and root canals, this is a good place. Luckily I've never had a root canal, but I needed a crown due to a cracked tooth and they quoted me a price about $300 lower than where I actually got the work done. I'm told their prices are low for other things too. However, I believe they lie to uninformed patients and scam them. Beware and absolutely get a second opinion!",16,dvnGnx6WcaA-icSwKHeuiw

From the outside it peaked our interest - there aren't many hotels you drive up to with a bright green and blue/white striped exterior. Then we saw the electric vehicle reserved spaces in the parking lot, which again is pretty cool. We walked over the circle drive asphalt of the typical gray-black mixed with surprising sparkles of blue rock, and into the lobby, which was already getting noisy from the crowd at Gallo Blanco. Our first favorite thing about the Clarendon is the front desk. The uber nice front desk lady not only offered us cold water bottles free of charge, she also got us some of the complimentary goodies. Here's bonus point #1: Your $20 a night service fee for the room not only includes parking, gym access, and internet (like a lot of hotels), but also long distance calling, and the desk has free cold water bottles, nutrigrain bars, Kit-Kats, Reece's

I tried to reason with these  people and they asked other managers if they could and the manager refused also.

I have purchased two dresses from this store for a couple cotillions that required 9 girls to purchase the exact same dress. The store is colour coordinated so it was great for that reason. The first dress was a red chiffon imitated floor length gown with a rose strap on one shoulder. The second dress was a purple v-neck knee-length dress with ruching at the front. 

The prices are less than average compared to most stores, but be mindful that you are paying for quality. All of us 9 girls had trouble keeping up one side of the first dress. There are several pictures of us holding up the one side of the dress, and yes we did try pinning the strapless side to our strapless bras however, it was a pretty heavy floor length gown. After the entrance and the waltz (which we spent the majority of the time pulling up our gowns) we all changed into our own dresses. 

A year after another friend (from the same cotillion) celebrated her birthday. This time it was pretty evident that floor length gowns, and a dress with minimal support is NOT a great choice for dancing. 

Make sure to try on the dresses in different sizes. Both my dresses are a size small, but the red one was too long and a bit too big. They are very limited in sizes because the x small was way too small, and it's not like I had a choice on what dress style I could purchase. The other dress was again, a bit big, but at least it had two thick straps for support. 

Now onto the store's service.

There is one lady that I met on both occasions. Blond, glasses, hair cut just before the shoulders. Doesn't smile, and looks irritated. If you have kids, especially a baby, she will ask you to leave. If you aren't buying or do not state what event you are purchasing a dress for, she will ask you to leave. We witnessed her doing this to other customers on both occasions. When purchasing, she will look at the size of the dress, then look at you from head to toe, and analyze if she thinks you are too big or too small for the dress. She did this to a couple of my friends after they tried on the dress. It was extremely rude and embarrassing, especially because the sizes she recommended did not fit right at all. 


If you would like to see a picture of the dresses and how they fit, you can message me.",11,zN7UEYPQwUQdDULm_pDWdQ

My taste bud enjoyed each and every bite of my potato, egg and cheese burrito......like a bite of heaven. The bill was super cheap, 15 for three people!

I have had to have root canals, crowns, and implants. ¬†Dr. Lerma refers you as appropriate, and does the completion work. ¬†She works with the crowns until they are perfect in your mouth. ¬†

The office runs behind at times. ¬†However, that is fine with me. ¬†If you are the one that has the emergency, and I have been, she will work you in ASAP, and even stay past working hours if that's what it takes. ¬†

She also has the best personality, and is so caring and easy to work with. ¬†If you are looking for a DDS, she's the one!",15,JMIkXDNDIcP0hZ1BhYdHxQ

I got the house sauce and the garlic Parmesan. They were both delicious, but that house sauce??!

It's cool you can bring your dog to eat with you, but you can only sit on the patio if you do. I will commend them as they were kind enough to put up with our ever-growing group. We started with 9 of us, but by the end of the night we had added 5 more. Our server was kind and patient with us while we all chose our food and drinks. Everything came out fairly quickly which was nice and unexpected for such a large party.

The menu is so strange. It's bar food but also has some Asian dishes and Southern comfort food. I ordered the fried chicken dinner which sounded so much more delicious than it was. Here is how they describe it. ""Hand-dipped buttermilk boneless chicken thigh, red skin potato mash, white gravy, spiced maple syrup, saut√©ed bacon + spinach, roasted sweet corn wheels"". Sounds amazing, right?? Well it might have been but the whole meal was super salty. I could only choke down about half before giving the rest to someone else. The chicken was more like chicken fried steak, and not like traditional fried chicken which was a let down. The spinach was good, but again too salty. I enjoyed the corn wheels that was the only thing that didn't seem to have salt. I washed my meal down with a 16oz Blue Moon. 

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. It did take a while to get refills and sides of sauces that were requested. We also had 2 items that came out wrong, but they were quickly corrected. This is probably a one and done for me.",8,JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q

Whether they have folded some paper napkins, or the server even speaks a word of English- you feel like you have been invited in as a guest and treated to a tasty dinner at often very low prices.  Now, if you are to take this wonderful experience and have admittedly some very nice tables and seating and throw fancy decorations on the wall, with mostly unauthentic servers, and have the same menu items at double or triple what it would normally cost AND your food doesn't taste near as good: that is what I experienced at Javier's.  At the end of the day I want to savor every bite.  I ordered the tampique√±a- a dish I have had before and absolutely loved at a family owned higher end place near Philadelphia, and I can't even compare the two honestly.  I tried a bite of a friends burrito and it was average at best.  Save your money if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas, and skip Javier's.",1,OFj6KTUzQaAi-ilVJ1OxlA

It was very refreshing and full of flavour.  It might be my imagination, but I think Eative's sorbet didn't melt as fast as the usual gelato or sorbet (is it because of the liquid nitrogen?).  This means you can savour it in the humid weather rather than eating it as fast as possible to avoid a puddle of goo in your cone/cup and risking brain freeze.
