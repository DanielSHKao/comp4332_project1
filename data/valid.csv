If you're a drive thru person I guess you're ok, seems like that's the only focus. Met a friend inside on 2 occasions, we ordered the flavored soda- about 4-5 customers after us got their hot beverages well before we got anything, both times. And both times we were asked what we were still waiting for. Um, yeah...those $5 sodas?? Oh! We'll get right to that. At least 6 ppl behind counter during each hour long visit- nobody seems to care that the tables and chairs are all askew, filthy- all kinds of wrappers and trash on the floor. There were 3 separate customers who were all alone, taking up the ""4-top"" tables w/laptops, leaving us the only halfway clean high top table in the corner-beside a trash can -- we asked for something to clean it off & were told that the ""napkins were by the door""-also telling them that all of the tables were dirty & sticky. But why would they come out from behind the counter to check the front of house when in all of the time we were there they didn't wipe the 'pick-up' counter??? It was freaking gross, and to neglect it even after being told, are you kidding me?? I saw one employee go on break, walked to door and back- didn't bother to take any kind of ownership by straightening the chairs, taking a look around to check cleanliness...this Starbucks is in my neighborhood, I was hoping that it would be good to get that kind of biz to help build the area a bit- I'm not so hopeful anymore. I gave this place 2 tries. My friend came from Glendale and she's told me that she'll never go to this location again because of what I said in this review. Very sad. I don't know who trains the staff, clearly there was no focus on the comfort or concern of the inside patrons. There should be a sign posted that a 4-top cannot be occupied by a single person too-especially when there are a few ppl taking up that space singly. (No place to put handbag on those tiny high top tables, the area is still kind of dicey, no chance you could safely place your handbag on the chairback out of your sight) SHAPE-UP, STARBUCKS, or like the many failed businesses in that space before you, you will FAIL!",3,mFSsnOKwN93wUvVVcOXFBA

They have wonderful happy hour specials and they do lots of special occasions so it's fun to see the celebrations. Their butter cake is my husband's favorite desert of anything anywhere. 

We recently went for his birthday and had delmonico steaks with a side of scallops. Wonderful. As sides we had chili Mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes. The potatoes were the best. They have a good wine selection. The lamb fondue is a favorite as well as deviled eggs. 

My only criticism is there bread isn't very good and when we got our leftover food to go, which was quite a bit, they either forgot my steak or mixed ours up with the other couple at our table.

To my surprise, there were people almost in every seat enjoying shakes and burgers. Yes, it was quite a busy day, but that didn't stop the swift service. 

We were seated immediately with super friendly servers who frequently checked up on us. 

Our meal: 

$16 The All American Burger - This was the burger I got. I thought, you can't go wrong with a classic burger, right? And I didn't. But it wasn't impressive enough to merit a cost of $16. It reminded me of the burger from Ketchup at Planet Hollywood which was slightly cheaper and tasted just the same. 

$19 The Mexico City - My girlfriend ordered this, but wasn't impressed. She came for the shake which was pleasing to her palate but as for this burger, not so much. I think the best word to describe it is lackluster. And for $19 a pop, I think we were pretty much disappointed because of the flavors. 

$15 The Cookie Shake - One of the best most inventive shakes I've tasted. It was rich and creamy as it was filled with bursting flavors from the beginning to the end. I also loved the presentation of the shake which made the entire visit worthy and appetizing. 

$15 Bam Bam Shake - This was the shake I never got to try because our friend ordered it but she definitely enjoyed it. It was colorful and appeared fruity. It's shakes like those that would probably keep us coming back again and again. 

Fries - Not a fan. It was your standard, frozen fries that lacked salt or any surprise flavors. Very basic for what you're paying for. 

Now, the boiling questions, would I come back? I think so. Just for dessert that is. Everything else could be acquired some place else.",5,PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w

I'm not a fan of the dumbed down over sugared, over salted Americanized fluff supposed Chinese places that have been serving in our lovely urban sprawl for some time.. THAT place starts with initials. Flo's offers many different regional specialties done very well. For instance the Calamari with Chile's was just plain awesome.. simple and fresh, crusted calamari with chile's, no sauce, sugar, goop or glop.. just simple and delicious.  The chicken curry skewers we're so tender and flavorful with the additional taste of coconut milk.. oh how I heart coconut milk! 

Service was good and the Tiger beers were nice and cold.. will certainly return to Flo's soon! Also to be mentioned, while this place gets busy not nearly the noise level of Thompson Peak.. actually very intimate considering the size of the dining room.

There were about 4 people ahead of us. Going in was cool 'cause there was an observant host. The guy was pretty badass looking - tattoos, ear piercings with a raspy tone of voice. LOL. But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple, and was like ""Hey guys, I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?"" Totally considerate, but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day, so I let him take their name down first instead. Same guy chatted it up with everyone that was waiting, wished everyone a good day when they left, and still managed to keep track of tables to fill, etc. 
Once seated, the good vibes and customer service didn't stop with him. We had Jasmine as our waitress, and she was extremely sweet and polite. She constantly checked up on us, even after we paid as we finished up the meals. Liked how she kept my coffee topped off 'cause I definitely needed it that morning/afternoon. Food was definitely tasty, came out warm from the kitchen, and was a decent portion for breakfast/brunch. 
Random, surprising moment of the meal was when my boyfriend got his burger, flipped the top bun off to spread ketchup, and the same host was like ""Hey buddy, lemme get you different lettuce... If my lettuce looked like that, I wouldn't want it.""

If you want a big-name DJ, lots of scantily-clad 21-year-olds and a slew of black-out drunk frat guys, this place may not be for you. BUT if you can appreciate a new concept, amazing talent and a speakeasy feel, you've found your Vegas Strip gem. 

My boyfriend, friends and I came here for NYE 2013; open bar for 2 hours was reasonable: $50 for girls, $75 for guys and included some appetizers (not passed around often enough and the quality was meh, but I wasn't there to eat). 

As you enter, you're greeted by a gold statue. I won't go into detail as it's not exactly PG-rated, but let me just say that it sets the tone for the rest of the club. You walk through a windy hallway to be spit out in the middle of the performing area. As other reviewers have said, there is no dance floor. Instead, the Act is set up like a theater. If you go upstairs, you're technically looking down at the ""stage"" from the mezzanine or balcony level. There are bars and bathrooms on both floors. 

The performances are really what set the Act apart from the rest. Not only are beautiful ladies hanging and twirling from the ceiling in little more than panties and garter belts, but some of them invite you up on stage to gyrate with them. There was also a performer beatboxing a medley of dance songs, which was probably my favorite part of the night. The acts don't interfere with your own party, though. No one stops the music to focus on the performers; instead, they just happen intermittently throughout the night and you're encouraged to join in. 

The concept of The Act is fresh and fun; I'll definitely be back and will recommend this club to all my Vegas-going friends.",3,qcmxfx2nWxpH2XtADyCrDg

Had to get a manager involved just to get two rooms in the same tower.  Front desk agent Stephany was awful and indifferent, and clearly just wanted to go home. Rooms were shabby: worn carpet, chipped porcelain in bathroom, and not even a coffee maker.    When we called down to ask for one, they said they don't offer then in standard suites anymore.  Air  conditioning only pumped out ice cold air, even when set to 77 degrees. All in all the worst Vegas experience I've ever had in more than 25 years of coming here.

For the past two years, I've been eyeing Serendipity as I passed it driving down the strip; the exterior is cute and decorated with huge frozen hot chocolates. I finally got around to trying the famous Serendipity and my experience was not at all what I had expected.. in a not so great way.

My good friend and I arrived a little after 9PM. We were given a wait time for 30-40 minutes. We were having such good conversation that I failed to even keep track of how long it had been. When our pager finally buzzed, we were led to the outdoor seating overlooking the strip. What I first noticed was the many empty tables. I guess they were just understaffed? Anyway, we sat down at an average looking table. For some reason I had pictured this place to be extremely cute and a lot more.. New York-ish? 

Our server took what felt like ages to even take our order and when he finally arrived at our table, he didn't seem enthusiastic at all. We ordered the large frozen hot chocolate for 2, which was $15. We both took a sip of the frozen hot chocolate at the same time and probably had the same surprised look on our faces. We were very disappointed with the quality of the ever so famous drink. It tasted no more like melted ice cream or even a super icy milkshake. My friend ordered what I believe was some sort of turkey sandwich, which was $17. The portion was decent. I didn't try the sandwich but the sweet potato fries weren't anything great.

I will definitely be back in Vegas but definitely not returning to Serendipity. Hype is hype but sometimes you gotta see it to believe it and in this case, don't believe the hype. Save your time and $15 and get a milkshake from Coldstone.",0,j0aLNLDM0H5CiUbduni-BA

Choose between A/C or furnace unit checkup). (NOT NEEDED) 

Made the appointment and two men came to my home I notice something wrong was the 'cleaner device': It was rather small with medium sucking power. What amazed me was the fact that this machine was put in only ONE ROOM vent - the kitchen. It was there quite along time but - how can one vent - clean all vents in the house? it didn't have enough sucking power to get the 'dust' from any duct or vent.

After mentioning to them, they disregarded my opinion, saying that 'this is the way its' done. No race intended - this Hispanic gentlemen worked the whole time they were here - but on the one air duct. However, the causation man just walked around. 

He did turn the temperature for air flow. He did remove a vent or two but no cleaning - as stated in coupon. I got concerned since I did not see him doing anything. Went into the utility room and he was standing there - I asked about the dryer vent ? And he said it was done LIE. I thought how could he do it when he did not move the dryer ? -Dryer top was totally full of things. a reliable contractor returned and told me THIS WAS NOT DONE.

After getting down from the ladder - the wanderer proceeded to show me a picture on his phone of dirty ducts - and said they were mine UPSALE Furthermore, he said I needed DEEP CLEANING at a cost of $200 a duct - recently had these inspected so this was a lie - somebody else ducts in the picture

. I had the choice of a furnace or A/C inspection. I said I have a contract with an excellent service company - the wanderer - insisted he look at it - but put my foot my foot down. UPSALE - the wanderer said they had an air filter unit they could sell me. I showed him my unit and said it was the best in the business - when I purchased my unit i was given a comparison of others on the market - none of this was provided. -

I've bought cars at Carmax (ugh) and found the experience to be uninformed and difficult. I have also bought from an East Sahara Honda dealership (shiesty!) and felt like the whole staff were overly-selling me. Since then, I have been very, very wary of car dealers and dealerships.

Findlay Chevrolet is so much different. The sales staff is more concerned with finding you a car you'll genuinely happy to own based on YOUR concerns, and not the bullet-point sales highlights they think you should care about. 

I went to Findlay two years ago because my previous vehicle suddenly died, and I was in desperate need of a reliable car. After much internet research (which, by the way, their internet department is stellar at keeping their online inventory up-to-date daily) I went to investigate a Certified '11 Mailibu. My major concern was cost-- the management and sales staff worked numbers until the car I wanted was in my budget with only over $1k down. Along with it came a maintenance package, and I was pleased every time I brought the Malibu in for service.

In fact, I took the Malibu in for service at the end of October, and started speaking with Brian about trading the Malibu for an Equinox. My husband and I had discussed moving up to a crossover so we could tote the dogs, kids and everything else easier than the sedan. Brian ran the numbers, and found extra dealer-offered incentives to negate the negative equity of the Malibu. Needless to say, for ten dollars more a month, Brian and the management at Findlay were able to get me into my beautiful 2013 Equinox. 

Since purchase, Brian  and Katherine in the business office have called to ensure my complete satisfaction with the car. I think that is a really nice touch-- it makes me believe more so that their real priority is my concerns and wants, and not their sales figures and commissions.

In closing, I would definitely recommend Findlay for new and used car purchases. They are professional, friendly, and really pride themselves on making the customer happy first.",1,8IgcBeeSyDMHQhHq7LNOwg

As of October 2013, Le Village is the only buffet in Vegas that offers reservations through Open Table.  When you have a reservation, you by pass the line and go through a separate entrance parlor that is also used by Total Rewards Platinum and Diamond members.   Waiting in line for 30 minutes to an hour for a buffet really stinks but with our reservation, we didn't wait at all!  And we were 15 minutes late for our reserved time.  One member of our party had Platinum status so it allowed us to use the special check in desk even if we hadn't had a reservation.  It also enabled us to be seated in a special area where we received special service.  What ""special service"" might you ask?  Our server was extra friendly but the great thing is that she offered to bring us steamed crab legs to our table!  At Le Village, the ""common people"" schlep up to the buffet line to help themselves and pick through the crab legs which are served cold.  Unlike at Bacchanal, where you can request the crab legs to be boiled and served hot, Le Village doesn't offer warm steamed crab legs except for the ""status"" diners.  And she brought hot bowl after bowl of hot juicy crab legs until we begged her to stop!  Being brought crab legs directly to your table elevates a buffet dining experience beyond the normal and makes dining so much more enjoyable.  After having gorged on so many crab legs, we only had enough room leftover to sample a few other dishes.  The only reason that I don't give Le Village 5 stars is because the selection of dishes doesn't rival that of Bacchanal.  But I actually did enjoy the crab legs better at Le Village because they were brought to our table and also they are not salty, unlike at Bacchanal.

Aside from the food, we also loved the slightly kitschy atmosphere of the French village.  The macarons and other desserts were very good (albeit not a huge variety like Bacchanal) and instead of standard soft serve, they offer frozen custard, which has a slightly different texture and richer taste.

At the end of our meal, our server brought to our table of 5 people 10 chocolate bar lollipops shaped like the Eiffel Tower, 5 dark chocolate and 5 white chocolate.  We later saw these identical treats in a gift shop in the hotel for $3.50 each! 

I'd highly recommend getting Platinum status so that you can enjoy the benefits!  If you don't want to gamble a lot to earn your status, you can instantly get Platinum status if you apply for and get approved for the Total Rewards credit card.",5,kB-IkuN1F5WUFdJz9iGs4w

I love the bar, which is massive and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I also enjoy the giant pasture painted on the wall with the signature cows.  My gripe with Zinburger is, of course, it is pricey.  To get a milkshake, burger, and fries, you are looking at spending $25 and that's without tip.  Yikes.

It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special.

If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top.

If there was ever an example of something being an ""assault on the senses"" this is it! It's one of those places where it's impossible to stick with your friends, even if you hold hands going through the dance floors. The club is packed to insane degrees and there are two huge floors to lose people.

Yes, it's aged and they still have coin operated slot machines, but it wasn't horrible.  My buddy stayed in the main building (i.e. not the tower or cabana suites).  He mentioned the price was $40/night and they comp you $20 in food per night and $20/night in slot play.  Not too shabby!  

His room was nothing more than a typical room at a Super8.  It had two double beds and a tiny bathroom, all of which were dimly lit by energy saving bulbs.  The walls were thin and you were pretty much outside until you walked into your room.  So there were no corridors or anything.  Pretty ghetto but hey, you're here to crash after long nights of drinking and gambling.  

The El Cortez has free parking but the garage is located about 200 yards from the hotel casino.  I imagine many of the people staying there are packing lightly anyway.  

We played there on a couple nights during our stay in Vegas.  They have $3 video blackjack - you know the one with the cheap porn stars as your dealer?  :-)  They have a couple of $5 blackjack tables, and enough slot machines to keep you happy for a day or two.  You'll probably get bored of this place quickly and if you want something more upbeat, you'll have to head over to the Fremont Experience (think Golden Nugget or Binyans).

This place is aged, as is the majority of the players in the casino, but if you're looking to get away from the rowdy crowd and not spend so much at their tables, give this place a try.  It may be a little intimidating sitting down next to a 70 yr old at the blackjack table but just remember you're playing against the dealer, not him.",1,nT9alA4GvQEcpviGMm1jtQ

The service has actually gotten very polite, friendly, and fast since my first visit which is why I'm giving them another star. 

The sushi may not be the BEST in town, but it's definitely good and the appetizers are even better. 

I really like that this place gives out a stamp card; it's a big incentive to keep coming back. The restaurant is also very nice and clean, which is always a plus.

To be honest, I was hesitant at first since I always stayed on the strip. I've walked through a few of the downtown hotels and wasn't too sure if I'd like GN.

We arrived at the hotel in the morning and left our luggage at the front desk while we gambled. At noon, we checked to see if a room was ready and were able to check-in. Recommendation: stay in the Gold Tower. It's close to the lobby, pool and front entrances. 

Our room was located on the 6th floor and had a king size bed. The room was clean and came with a keiureg. Everything looked fine (not old and/or dingy). 

If you bring your own k-cups, it's free to use. If you need k-cups, it is $15...If you pay the resort fee, you do get two bottles of water for free as well as wifi for two devices. 

In regard to food: the hotel does have a Starbucks, Claim Jumper, a steak place, the Grotto (Italian food), convenience store and a small snack place.

The pool is something to check out! There is a water slide which slides through a shark tank! It's super cool. If it weren't so cold outside, I'd check it out.

In addition, the property also has a gym.

In regard to transportation. You can self-park or valet. Taxi pick-up and drop off is available at the front of the hotel; however the pickup for Uber/Lyft is at another entrance in Carson tower.

I have suffered from sleep apnea for years and have unsuccessfully tried the CPAP option - CANNOT SLEEP with the CPAP.  I visited the Chandler ""Core Sleep Solutions"" and in TWO short weeks Core Sleep Solutions basically changed my life!

I had tried a few appliances advertised on TV, however, none of them worked and they were PAINFUL to use.  I later discovered some people can ruin or lose teeth trying different TV offered appliances.  The oral appliance Dr. Core prescribed is PAINLESS and simple to use.

The process leading to the appliance was also simple.  The first visit consisted of x-rays and verbal discovery of my overall health.  The following visit consisted of a home sleep study confirming my sleep apnea and nightly oxygen depletion.  A succeeding visit entailed taking a molding image of my teeth.  Ultimately, I was issued the oral appliance.  Very simple steps.

The staff informed me of what to expect (increase and tapering off of dreams) and encouraged me to contact them if I experienced problems or side effects.  All questions were answered and I left their office looking forward to my first decent sleep in years!

The first night I had THIRTY dreams (it was like the Dream Flood Gates had opened).  The dreams subsided to a comfortable THREE a night by the end of the first two weeks.

I immediately noticed chest pains (from my over-beating heart) disappeared.  Not only was I sleeping through the night without choking, I felt RESTED and GREAT.  

Additionally, I discovered an increase in energy (enough to get me started on a walking exercise routine to lose weight).  Now I have energy to burn!

Dr. Gary Core and his Awesome Staff have literally SAVED MY LIFE!  It's WONDERFUL to sleep and wakeup refreshed.  2015 started with the unexpected loss of a family member and is ending with my life being restored!  

In a nutshell, ""Thank You, Dr. Core"" for my 2015 Christmas Gift""!

As we wandered around in the dark looking for the restaurant, it felt like we were in an episode of the Twilight Zone. Lots of businesses closed, vacant buildings, and no other people walking around. Very creepy.

After wandering around for at least 20 minutes, we finally found the place. We stood for some time, waiting to be acknowledged by the staff to be seated. A female server finally took notice of us. We told the server we were there for the wine tasting, but would like to sit and have dinner as well. She told us to sit anywhere and pointed to where the wine tasting was being held in the restaurant. She didn't even bother to give us a menu. She hurried to seat the patrons that were behind us in line and gave them menus. We were irritated and offended, so we left. 

Avoid this establishment like the plague. I can't believe this establishment treats patrons this way. You would think they would appreciate any patronage they can get, considering many of the businesses at Lake Las Vegas have gone out of business.

Anyways, we called hansens plumbing and he came out right away even though it was after hours. He slaved away in the bathroom and at some point I'm pretty sure power tools were involved. He found out the plumbing was backed up way further than just our store. We called the maintenance in again so he could point out to them that they were wrong. In the end Scottsdale quarter ended up insisting they use their own plumber, but it was nice to have someone finally figure out the issue and have our back on what we thought was the problem in the first place.

However, the front of the house has failed us twice and I give them zero stars.  On our first visit, we had a reservation and still had to wait.  They were overwhelmed and my girlfriend and I are understanding of dinner rushes so we didn't have a problem with it.  The food was delicious on our first visit and we just chalked it up as a one-off where it was just one of those busy rushes.

Fast forward to last Friday, 3/20, and we were seated and unable to even get a drink or bread.  This time, the restaurant wasn't even full.  After 20 minutes, I said to the hostess that I believe our waiter forgot about us.  She replied that he was double-sat tables.  The tables were outside and we were inside which could make her at fault which having a server have to run around an entire restaurant is incredibly inefficient.  As a former bartender/server, I understand how cumbersome this can be.  However, the hostess stating that he was double-sat tables essentially tells us that we are the least important of his tables.  She did politely take our drink order and after a total of 25 minutes, with only water at our table, we couldn't take it anymore and left. 

Since this is the second time this has happened, it's clear that the owners/managers are at fault for being too cheap to hire additional servers. Or, they're hiring servers that are inept at handling any sort of volume.  

In conclusion, the back of the house here rocks!  It's a shame that the front of the house is sinking the ship.  We've given them two times to get it together and they have failed us each time.

I've owned a restaurant for several years, so I tried my best not to leave a horrible review because I understand the frustration from an owner's perspective.

However, after several trips to this location, I couldn't possibly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Ever. I've never been in the place where the workers move at anything more than a hybrid sloth/turtle speed. I work in the area, so I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and try again and again. Every time, I've sworn to myself not to return, but the quality and price of the pizza kept me coming back.

Until now. I finally cracked. With one person in front of me, it literally took 12 minutes for them to make my simple pie and put it in the oven. I was borderline twitching. Luckily there's another franchise closer to where I live or I'd be done with this chain for life.

Nice draft selection, hubby got the Columbus IPA and I stuck with a Bud Light bottle. We ordered onion wedges-which were good. The tempura batter was a little gummy on the inside but the bourbon steak sauce for dipping was HEAVEN. I could have skipped the cumin ranch as it didn't mix well with the steak sauce. Hubby had chicken n waffles which was over half gone before I could get my phone out to take a picture--it was really good. He devoured the maple bacon mac n cheese--said it was heavenly. I ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was under a heading of shared plates--definitely not enough to share but I also wouldn't want to. It was a little sad that it wasn't hot (probably so the hubby's waffle could be hot) but it was divine. Lots of lobster and the asparagus was amazing.

We were able to use the Club Lounge where there was free daily breakfast and hor d'oeuvres in the evening. It was a good deal except that the food served in the Lounge was really lacking in quality and quantity. I've stayed at other Sheraton hotels and the food has always been of stellar quality. But since it was free for us, I won't complain too much. If I was paying $200++ a night for the room, then I might rant about the quality of the food in the Lounge.

When the casinos and hotels decide to retire their glitz and trade it for a new look, what happens to the classic sparkle?  Thankfully, the people who run the Neon Museum saved what others wanted to throw away.  And they've put together an amazing collection of Vegas neon signs from the past.  

The Neon Museum or Neon Boneyard is one of the most unique places Vegas has.  It's not a copy of Italian or French or Egyptian culture.  It's Vegas culture and Vegas history and its incredible.  The Boneyard is filled with signs from the 40s through the 90s that hung high above the Vegas strip, lit up with bright neon and hundreds of light bulbs.  

The volunteers and curators that run the museum offer a reservation-only guided tour through the signs explaining their history and significance in the world of neon art.  And it's really inspiring to listen to them explain the place these signs held as icons in Vegas past.

For lovers of Vegas, this is a treasured place--a place that captures some of the ghosts of Vegas past.  It's also a place that proves remains surprisingly undiscovered.  Right now it's still an impressive collection of signs that are housed in an empty lot just north of 95.  But the plans to build a visitor center and a better organized space should lift the Boneyard 's prominence up a little higher.

That was 15 years ago and since then, it has been my benchmark for every steakhouse I go to.  Don Carson knows his business well, no question and when you go there, he is usually wandering around the restaurant visiting with guests and keeping an eye on the place. I've not had anything bad there, ever, and I think I've pretty much tried everything on their menu. If you want good steak, prime rib or ribs.  Go here.

I've been coming here more for the breakfast than the lunch/dinner with my hubby when we want to just have a nice moment to ourselves and eating outside to enjoy the time underneath the big old trees. I really enjoy their coffee, though sometimes it's a pain to wait for the only carafe available at one time. A suggestion would be to put out some kind of coffee bar like they do with the condiments bar and fountain drinks area (and have more than one carafe of reg/decaf out). MUST COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN because the lines will be outrageous, especially on the weekends!

Their fresh fruit garnishments are fresh and delicious and I do like the taste of their syrup and Belgian waffles. I'm not a fan of the piece of flatbread they put on the side when you order the meat and potato scramble because it's really just that - flat, but not tasty. I think it's out of place with the rest of the meal. My hubby likes the waffles and fruit (as do I) and the Joe's Big Breakfast. He likes his breakfast with a variety on the plate. Oh! I forgot to mention that the other breakfast I enjoy is the Chicken and Mushroom Scramble - totally fresh and delicious! Since I mentioned the kiddos, they really enjoy the chicken tenders...not greasy, they're flavorful and super super fresh!

The prices are a little steep when it comes to the food and the size of the portions (except for Joe's Big Breakfast), but it's farm fresh and I'm okay to spend just a little bit more when it's just me and the hubby. If I wanted the gluttony and bring the kids along, we'll go to Black Bear Diner to satisfy the portions and prices which we enjoy very much.

My best advice is to get the classic Yard Dog (32oz) size -- if you're looking for high alcohol content, your answer lies in the 44 Magnum: a mix of Hurricane and 190 Octane. It might not be as tasty as some of the other flavors, but you'll get the best bang for your buck! I also recommend adding an extra shot (only $1!). Of course, all the flavors are delicious if you don't care about how much alcohol there is, but my second choice is always Pina Colada, Mardi Gras Mash, or Margarita with added salt on the top of the cup.

**NOTE** I would highly advise against buying anything with more volume than the Yard Dog unless you're splitting it with one or more people. I'm not questioning the volume you can drink, only the speed -- you do not want a melted daiquiri on your hands. It's disgusting. 

All the workers here are so, so lighthearted and do their best to make you laugh. I've never seen a single worker at Fat Tuesday without a smile on their face.

The worst aspect about this place is that because of its great location (in the Miracle Mile shops), it's the most popular Fat Tuesday in Vegas -- and the line can get incredibly long. However, they do try to make it as efficient as possible by making sure you have your ID out at the front of the line. If you're waiting with friends, it shouldn't take too long to get your drink. This should go for all of Vegas, but don't forget your ID! They only accept certain forms of identification, so if you have an ID card from another country, it's safest to just bring your passport. 

**TIP** Bring back your old container and save a few bucks on your next drink! For the Yard Dog (32oz), a regular drink is $14, and the discounted price is $11.",1,V4nNUVs8X9ncc8eAJ9unvg

Tamale: very good. chunky bits of meat inside, verde sauce on top. It was spicy with no menu warning, but I like spicy. Very good sauce, big tamale.

Enchilada: very little sauce, filled with shredded chicken. Chicken was kind of chewy. It was well seasoned, but not flavoured. Bland.

Chile Relleno: This was the densest batter I'd ever seen. I'm used to an egg batter on one of these, but this was more like a 50/50 egg batter corn cake mix. It was like eggy corn bread, which sounds like it would be pretty good, but wasn't. Very dense, very bland. I ended up just cutting through the coating to the chile inside, which was well cooked, and the filling was good. 

Beans and rice: tasted like they were straight out of a can. not seasoned, not a good texture.

Salsa that came with the chips: canned.

If I had just gotten pork tamales with verde sauce instead of the combo plate, I probably would have given this place a 4. 

The place was dirty. Clean tables. Dirty carpet, lots of old food in-between the cracks in the booths. Waiter was filthy, like he'd been helping out in the kitchen and wiping his hands on his pants and apron.",2,1dubTBA-sk2h5yzVwAbO2w

I showed up around 1130 in the morning and the place was empty.  The staff was very friendly and greeted me upon entry.  I got oatmeal and black coffee.  The oatmeal was delicious, but the coffee was a little watered down.  That may have been due to the odd time of day, but that's the main reason I'm docking the place one star.  The other reason being that, while I enjoy the decor and overall feel of the place, there aren't enough large tables.  There's one 6-person table, but the small tables could be just a little bit larger.  Can't really spread out for studying/working purposes very easily.

For one, the area we were seated in was right below some speakers and they had the cranked up to 11 and we just about had to yell constantly to have conversation. It was kinda interesting in a way because after a while people just kinda subconsciously gave up on conversation and by the end of the evening a few of us were just sitting there quietly. Anyways, along with our drinks we ordered a pretty good assortment of ""bar"" type food. Sandwiches, wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, french fries, nachos and even pizza. I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal. They do seem to have a very good drink selection though and a full bar even though the drinks are a little overpriced. If I could say one good thing about the place it is that the wait staff seemed very friendly and was on top of their game. Our server didn't mess anything up and kept all our drinks filled.

Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.

In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  

The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.

I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    

The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  

Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.

The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!

Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.

Hubby had the fajitas and there were very good and tasty. He added cheese, and our server explained there was an extra charge for it. That is something that I always appreciate.

Although the service wasn't exactly the smartest cause we were trying to share some appetizers but waiter dropped it off w/ no plates and one utensil. -_- 

With that said, I thought the  curry was great. I got level 5 and I thought it was great. It was spicier than I thought it would be but I also tried a lvl 9 and it tasted the same for odd reason so I say just get the lvl 5...save the extra cents. The pork katsu was really good. I usually get scared when they put a lot of fat into my pork(where they basically rip you off cause it's so much fat) but that didn't happen. Croquette was okay too. Really, the spotlight was the curry + pork katsu cause it really tasted great.

The one thing I did mind was the amount of rice curry ratio. So little rice(the curry amount was fine) but I didn't want my rice to be all drenched up because of how little rice they give me.

I came on a Friday at about 11:45am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time I left around 12:30pm, it seemed like quite the place to be, especially for business lunches/convention attendees. 

I went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.  I did just that with this delicious dish with a nice spiciness that you usually don't get from traditional brunch options.  My meal came with three options of bread as well: raisin, jalapeno, and corn.  The jalapeno was the only one in which I would recommend; the other two were just eh.

My benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.

we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before the first skewer came to our table, which was pork loin. i'm more of a beef guy and would normally pass, but i was hungry. it was very juicy depite getting one of the outer slices, but the crust made it even more enjoyable. this got my hopes up which were later shot down.
the other meats that came out were, roasted ham, sirloin, spicy chicken, pheasant, and bacon wrapped turkey. the ham tasted like it came from a store. the only thing i liked about the poultry is that they are not sliced so you know you get a fresh piece, as opposed to our ham and pineapple. (it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet.

As they got off the aircraft my elderly mothers asked the customer ""service"" agent where the London gate is?

Seriously! This is how you speak to ELDERLY passengers who PAY YOUR BILLS! Today, Monday, my parents have still not received their luggage, and they left Winnipeg Wednesday! Amazing! You had plenty of opportunity to reroute my parents, move them to the next day, fly them via Toronto, Chicago or JFK, but no!

Not to mention a doggie sundae bowl with 3 mini doggie bones served with vanilla soft serve ice cream for a summer reward for any canine companions anyone has out there! Not to mention other food and beverages that are offered outside of the tasty, refreshing flavorful frosty delights!

I used to stop off for a Blue Moon ice cream cone once a week after work... Now that was a time long, long time ago. With the kids nowadays it's heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to King Kone we all go! There's no more solo ice cream trips without kids anymore, but now King Kone has become a special family staple that represents Chardon and the good in this community... Keep up the great work you've all been doing to keep this Chardon gem a treasure!",0,iVBYrIx_rKMYPlzyVTzsFQ

I love the family feel and thr taco and margarita specials on Tuesdays. The only feedback I would provide is two times I've gone there I did not realize they were yet closed and the doors were still open and then I went in I was immediately told they were closed and they could not serve me and I was rushed back out the door. I do understand when you're closed you're closed as everyone wants to go home but if your doors are still open there is a better way to handle that and make me feel that I'm still a valued customer.

The wait staff redid the cocktail for me, however it was still super sweet so they offered to comp me for it at the end of the meal. For the main meal I had the three pastas dish which was good but nothing stellar or imaginative. The gnocchi was defintiely the star of the dish and something I would go back for. For dessert I ended up having an expresso martini which was delicious and definitely something to try.

The doctors have changed a few times but have always been great. The problem I have currently have is that the office staff is well, terrible. I needed to come in for specific immunizations, scheduled the appt and arrive only to find out that I was scheduled the one day of the week they don't offer them. So, I take another hour and a half to come back the next day and get it taken care of. In the meantime the office staff tries to collect payment for a well visit (which is always covered by insurance). I then need to return for more immunizations the following week (which the nurse told me is always covered) and the day before the appt they call to get insurance information. Uh, I was there a week ago and pretty sure it hasn't changed. Ok, their mistake. At the second, or actually third, visit they again ask for payment for an office visit. I tell the office staff that the nurse told me that follow up immunizations are always covered. No, she was incorrect. You still have an office visit to pay for. Ugh. The nurse should not be giving information regarding fees if they don't know for sure. 

Secondly, not to be mean but entire staff is not exactly the epitome of health. Most could use a gym membership and a touch of makeup. If one works in a professional health environment they could at least look like a good example.",3,OpmFNR3NJqnKIy8t-FImRw

We were the only table (2pll) in the restaurant 
I ordered a soup -kimchi soup 
I TOLD the server that I was vegetarian so no beef or chicken or anything other than tofu. 

She brought me a soup... I tasted and it tasted strange... 
I asked another server to please ask what time of broth was in my soup, what was the base... 
and guess what. It was beef... BEEF 
If you are vegetarian/vegan 
You know what this feels 
I literally felt sick to my stomach. Then she was like oh sorry I'll make you a new one and went to the back of the restaurant to tell the chef and the other server what had happened and they were laughing... 
I obviously told them I didn't want anything else and left.
What would have happened if I was allergic to meat? 
This is unacceptable. 
I'm so furious. 


The food was really great, lots of options for everyone! They have vegetarian dishes, seafood dishes and lots of beef and pork dishes.

They take forever to fix anything wrong with the house. We're renting a three bedroom and can't even use the one of the rooms bc of water leakage. Calling Cynthia does nothing! Their handyman shows up drunk and can't fix anything right. He just does quick fixes and we're still having the same problem. Now they're saying we haven't renewed our lease since 2013!!! 

Take note and DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! 
 
Sending in a complaint to the real estate board. Let's see how they like that!



This is so frustrating! My husband went to talk to Cynthia. The handyman they continue to send out is her husband. He has shown up drunk. He admitted to not knowing how to fix the roof and ceiling. When my husband told her this, she started yelling at him, saying he does know how to f*#!'ing fix it. Mind you, he was in his uniform! At that point he walked out and called professional standards at the real estate board. Talking to them, they were absolutely appalled at them. I had to call my dad, his name is on the lease still. He called Tami- she is not a licensed realtor- and told her what was going on. My dad is currently battling cancer again. She told him that she would take care of this for him. That they would be sending out a professional roofing company out to fix the problem. This was on 04/12/16. She also asked my dad to ask us not to send in the complaint to the board. 


10 days go by and I had not heard anything. It started to rain again so I call Tami. I asked her what was going on with the roofer. She puts me on speaker phone to talk to Cynthia about it. I don't see why she had to talk to her when she assured my dad that she would take care of this. I remind her of that, so she yells at me that, that's not her job and she never said that. By now I am pretty irate over this situation. I yelled back at her saying this is disgusting the way they treat their tenants and no one should have to deal with this. I also told her that was going to send in the complaint finally since they do not want to fix this problem. All she said was do what you have to do. Not once has she said sorry, or I'll do what I can, or anything that was helpful. 

I immediately call the board. 

04/25/16 Jan from the board calls me back. Gives me some instructions on what my options are. Apologizes for what we have to go through. 

04/25/16 a roofer comes at 0730. He works for KB Homes. Finally a pro! He climbs on the roof and tells my husband that he was scared up there. The roof is closing to collapsing!! He comes inside to take pictures. Wes their shoddy repair work in my daughters room. Even he is appalled!! Tells us that he will get his crew out next week. 

04/29/16 my husband pays rent. Speaks to Tim. Asks to speak to their broker to make him aware of his employees and their attitudes. Tim gives my husband a card for their ""broker"" but the card just says he's another realtor. 

My dad calls me saying this company wants to look at the roof. We Google to number and it comes up with the name Cynthia. Why a diff company? 


This is how they treat a member of law enforcement!!",3,JEdU91t2ucPw-e__2eXnfg

I found it to be too dry for good sushi rice and lacked the flavor I've grown accustomed to for sticky sushi rice. Especially for this area this place doesn't really stand out above the crowd.",0,-K5tVZjZv1dXQVSROJkM2Q

You probably only need to order half or less food as you would normally order at any other restaurant.  While the beer selection is not expansive, it is quite good for a chain restaurant.  One of the coolest things is their dog friendly patio.

Despite hopping with customers on a Friday night at 8pm, they had us seated in under 20 minutes.  After reading many yelps regarding the Chicken Pot Pie, Dave decided to give it a try.  It was good, but the best thing we tasted was the seasonal mushroom barley soup with giant chunks of mushroom.  Normally the barley overwhelms a soup, but this was just right.

I ordered the ribs.  The meat was nicely cooked, but the sauce was too sweet and the mashed potatoes and succotash were lifeless.  I asked for some butter and to my surprise they brought me some garlic butter, which helped give some life to the potatoes.",3,KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w

The experience turns negative when they have an open kitchen and a tall guy just stares at you as soon as you enter the restaurant like he has a beef with you...
The boys ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs, I ordered Stromboli. $35 for a gas station pizzeria seemed high but hey what is cheap these days....
Spaghetti and Meatball arrived quickly and the boys thought they were OK.... waitress comes after a while and tells me it would just be a little longer on the Stromboli.....5min. later I actually see them push the Stromboli in the oven....the kids were half way through...so I go to the counter and ask if that was mine....and was told it is....At that point I lost appetite with the guy staring at me and asked for my money back for the pizza. This was complied with but there was no offer to have the pizza that they obviously screwed up. Most other places would have offered. The chef took the half baked pizza out of the oven and let it sit on top a shelf...not sanitary at all 9hopefully you weren't the lucky guy who ordered this later..... The boys took another 7 minutes to eat so I had the pleasure of watching them eat and overhear the table beside us talk about the pizza being like cardboard anyways....

Sushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.

While I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.

I purchased a vintage shellback lounge chair from Craigslist and knew I wanted it to be re-upholstered when I purchased it. I purchased (what I thought) was the correct fabric in a pattern I liked and went over to Sit-Well based on Yelp reviews. 

Upon arriving I was greeted by Rick who informed me immediately that the fabric I had purchased was not upholstery quality so we would need to go another route. They had 100's of fabric books to choose from and he helped me find a similar fabric to the original that I brought but ultimately I decided to go a different route with a beautiful high quality blue velvet. He was able to purchase the fabric for me at discount through the manufacturer vs what I would have paid going to buy it on my own.

The chair turned our BEAUTIFUL, I was so pleased with the final product and felt the pricing was fair given the detail of the chair. Not only did they do an amazing job upholstering but also touched up some of the wooden legs to remove some scuff marks from the previous owner.

I found that Rick (while having a slightly aggressive / unique communication style) was knowledgeable about the business and eager to make sure I was happy with the product.

To top off my overall amazing experience, the owner (Frank), gave me a call about 2 months later to confirm I was happy with the product and my overall experience. It is clear that this business is important to him and that personal touch with the extra phone call was amazing.

Tried this place today, and got here at about 5:00 pm. I was the only one here.

1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.

2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.

3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty ""well to moderately fleshed"".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....

4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.

6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.

7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.

Overall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds. Compared to In and Out of Five guys, there is no comparison, however, it is certainly edible.  Hey, if you need 500 wings, this is the place to try.",1,owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g

 Love the long narrow space with the super long counter and they have both front + back patio.
Free wifi and electric outlet are available, which is great if you want to hangout for a bit.
Love the back patio

Cappuccino $3.10
~ It was a darker traditional roast which I like.

 Love all the details from the wood back board to the scale table for cream & sugar.
Just love the lighting along the bar

Verdict :
~ Will be back, maybe with my laptop this time to work on a post or two (?_?)
~ Love their cappuccino
~ Will definitely come back to try their drip and their Sakanjebin which is a traditional Persian drink with mint, cucumbers and lemon (guess it`ll be almost like a mojito without the alcohol)",2,i8A3MWU33_mtMu3LUMlnWQ

If you're not a fan of strong drinks this might not be the place for you. I guess it's partly my fault for not asking but I was overwhelmed by the scene.

I will say that I doubt it is like this all the time but when we went there were a group of people who were dressed in cosplay.

I decided to give K&B another go and went on a Sunday afternoon around 3 PM with my boyfriend. It was super busy, which is a good sign ! We were seated after about a 10 minute wait. The girl who brought us to our table and brought us our drinks ...and that was probably the last we've seen of her until the end. 

The food did improve, I'll give it that but service wise it seems to have gone down since my first visit. However it was a really busy night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a minute. 

I strongly recommend K&B consider having guests be able to send in their orders themselves, especially in a crowded night because I had to wait 15 minutes to get my order sent in. Not only that, but while waiting we tagged down a girl server who just finished delivering all the food on her tray to the tables and she literally waved us off? She just walked away and didn't even return or send anyone else. If she had some food left to bring out then I'd understand but she had an empty tray and it takes no more than 30 seconds to send in orders... also, when our food did come out, the food with sauce like the gyoza ... the sauce was spilled all over the plate and the gyoza got all soggy like wtf? At least make sure the food is presentable, I don't care how busy it is. This has NEVER happened to any other AYCE sushi restaurants I've been too, and this place is more pricey then most. If I'm going to pay more for AYCE, I expect service to be up to par or even better. 

There was this one male server who was absolutely fantastic ! He helped us move to a bigger table, helped every other table as much as he can and he's the one who sent our orders in most of the time. I also noticed that he would stop what he was doing if he saw customers needing help sending their orders in ... something the girl serve we flagged down should take note of. 

Food is pretty great, but it'd be awesome if they give mayo for the karaage... anyways food is 4/5. Service is 3/5... I would put 1.5 but the male server is just too awesome. They need to find more servers like him. 

Still debating if I want to go back. I'll go back when I feel like waiting for 15 minutes for orders to be sent, to be waved off by a server and have food come out soggy because the sauce spilled everywhere on the plate!!",5,SMkOnEZkfHPdCUmQM2Qn8g

Some of the existing wait staff are still here while others are gone - no longer protected under their union. One wait staff has been promoted. The original chef at LWH has been replaced by the one that used to work at LTH. 

I don't notice it, but many say the cooking is different; One is more modern/fusion (LTH), while the other was more classic Canton.

Either way, I still think the food is very good. And so does my family as we loved LTH when it was open. And since my family were familiar with staff at LTH, nothing much has changed for us. Service is still excellent (we love it how we get our special hot sauce when we come). And the food? They now have Egg Tarts for Dim Sum (I still remember the dismay when they removed that from the menu). And anyone remember those long, fried, shrimp rolls at LTH? Yup! They have brought that classic over here!

Despite the mixed comments I have heard about the new management, I won't complain. I, and my family, are still grateful that there IS a LWH.

I walked in with my friend and the place was dimly lit, music wasn't too loud and this place was totally live. The atmosphere can work for a date night or a friends get together. We were seated along with our friends and the server Sarah was so friendly and thoroughly explained the dinner specials. Earlier in the day I had a huge double angus burger so I had no room for dinner but still needed to eat something ( hate that feeling). After I browsed through the menu, I decided to order some apps. I ordered the angus short rib sliders and the calamari. The server was really attentive and brought out all of our food at once. Now let me tell you about these 3 moist, flavourful, soaked in BBQ sauciness sliders.. Ahhh so good! I was thinking to order another round but then I thought to myself ""you ding bat you could've ordered an entree"". Anyway sad to say, the calamari wasn't too good. It was so salty and I actually started to get a headache from how overly salty it was! I got the servers attention and told her about the calamari and she was more than happy to get us something else. I took a good look at the menu again and decided to try the Mediterranean dip platter. After waiting about 10 minutes, she came out with med platter and I digged right in. The platter had pita and tortilla chips, with these three incredible dips; hummus, sundried tomato feta dip and calamata tapenade. It was so delicious that I ended up getting more chips because there was so much dip left. Now I'm awfully curious to try everything else on the menu.

I first heard about GG through my foodie friends; one of the first waves of food trucks that took Toronto by storm a couple of years ago. Their fun and portable take on mexican food brought them legions of fans. 

So imagine my delight when they opened a bricks and mortar location in my neighbourhood, just as my wife an I moved in. 

It had to be fate.

Even better, they promised delivery, combining two great ideas: mexican food and sitting on our butts waiting for someone to feed us. 

Excited, we placed an order for chicken tinga and carnitas burritos, with a side of guacamole and nachos. 

We waited, and waited, and waited. Longer than expected, but we've waited longer. 

The food came lukewarm, but we've had colder. 

We were impressed that they threw in a couple of soups...less so when it became apparent that said soups were basically canned cream of mushroom. But we've had worse.  

Around $35 for two, but we've had more expensive. 

Overall, the portions were stingy...but we'be been hungrier. 

But I'll tell you what was abundant: raw onion.

Like seriously, never in my life have I eaten food more beset by raw white onion. It's like they ran short of other ingredients...like avocado, or chicken, or pork, or water, and just decided ""hey, let's just throw some more raw white onion in. They'll never notice, and who doesn't love raw onion?""

Let me be clear: i'm no onion bigot. Onions lie at the heart of most things I cook and enjoy eating. French onion soup for example, with it's deeply caramelized alium base, if one of my all time faves. Raw onion burrito, not so much. 

So much onion. like finding ants in your picnic basket, or bedbugs in your hotel sheets. 

My wife was reduced to picking tiny onion dice out of her tortilla, one at a time; then scanning the burrito's entrails before hazarding another bite. 

Me, I grinned and bore it, then brushed my teeth for 45 minutes and rinsed with a gallon of Listerine until the insides of my cheeks squeaked. 

So yeah; if we feel like mexican but don't want to go out, this gringo will stick to his own kitchen.

Carlos was extremely friendly, personable and an overall excellent hair stylist. He  gave me everything I asked for and more - I got a partial highlight, cut and moisturizing treatment.

In my 3 visits, I've waited no less than 45 minutes per appointment, despite arriving early.  I think in the 5 hours I've spent here, 10 minutes have been with the doctor.  The facility itself looks like it was built 40 years ago and never renovated.  Some rooms I've met staff in didn't even have lights on; not exactly a pristine and bright medical facility. 

On my new patient forms I marked a cancer history twice, but the doctor seemed surprised when I asked for an oncologist recommendation.  The doctor also ordered blood work analysis on my behalf, said ""here's the blood work analysis information you requested!"", and gave me a 20 page ""book"" of things I could have read online. I have no idea how much this cost, but it's not worth the paper it's printed on. The doctor also recommended I go outside to get more sun, saying it might ""improve my mood"".  While getting my temperature taken, the nurse said ""oh, this isn't working, I don't quite know why, do you have a fever?""

Been here countless times over the years, but it is pretty much the same (if it hasn't gotten worse).

Parking is a nightmare, as there are literally no spots at any time, and it seems everyone is fighting over the spots that are available, making driving conditions terrifying.

Once you get inside, there is essentially a maze of stores, and you can never seem to find anything more than once. You kind of just stumble across a store and go in. A lot of the stores repeat, as there are many stores under one owner, and they all have similar or identical stock. However, prices are usually dramatically cheaper and you can haggle from time to time, depending on the store. Some of the smaller food vendors upstairs are quite good though. Some of the best curry beef balls can be found here!

Overall, this is one of the malls that I hate going to, but is the go-to place to get certain things. If you're in the market for cheap phone accessories, everyday items, makeup, or even clothes, this is a good place to go (if you don't mind the parking and crowds of people of course!).",3,clmrlflES5HrXS-gl_YmrQ

The portion was also huge! Which isn't bad but for a single person it's almost impossible to finish. My gyro was really good! Good amount of meat and I was surprised that they didn't mess up my specific instructions for it. However a little bit more sauce and feta in the gyro would have been good. The side of hummus was HUGE I was not expecting THAT much hummus. I think I maybe had a few scoops and then I was full. Definitely enough to feed 4-6 people.

A couple of weeks ago, I took my main Dyson to this store for cleaning.  I hadn't had it back there during that 2  1/2 years. I have three dogs, and vacuum constantly.  I took it there because I have a carpet remnant in the back of my SUV. I vacuumed after one of the dogs spilled their water bowl on the rug, and it was damp when I vacuumed. I didn't know it at the time. Water accumulated in the canister. After that, I figured that it was time to get it professionally cleaned out - something that I had not done in those 2  1/2 years.  

Well, the guy that took my vacuum was a little too sassy for me. He complained about the Dysons, and how I needed another brand. They have Simplicity and Sebo which are both in the $800 range. I wasn't interested, so he wasn't interested.  He gave me the ticket, and I left. 

Later, he called me to tell me that the vacuum had ""dog p*ss"" (dog urine) and that it would cost me much more to have it cleaned.  He was very angry on the phone, and I had to correct his language. By the time they added everything up, they wanted over $200. I ended up paying $140 just for the cleaning and filters.  

After I got the vacuum back, I went to another (non-related) vacuum store. Vegas Vac did not put the filters in correctly, they did not let the vacuum dry out, the vacuum did need a new roller, but it also needed a new belt. They did not notice the belt.  When I got the vacuum from Vegas Vac, a different guy was there.  He did not seem interested and did not offer to help me out with the vacuum.  He just watched me stumble out of the store with it.  I don't know if they changed management or ownership, but the service has gotten worse. I guess that if you want to spend $1000 on a vacuum, you are in luck.

Sushi Way has an extensive menu and their quality of fish and the way the chefs prepare it is as good as it gets.

I knew from a quick peruse of googlemaps that there were 3 ethiopian places near by, so we thought we'd try one. Our first stop was a quick run-in and run-the-heck-out again of Queen of Sheba (See my review: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-queen-of-sheba-restaurant-toronto#hrid:nqC7Km2BiOMgmfsjC7uP1Q) and Nazareth had a huge line, so we popped into African Palice. 

It didn't take long for our beautiful veggie platter to arrive, along with two small plates of a folded, flat bread like substance. It was drool at first sight, and we were pumped to dive in--until we realized that we had no idea how to eat it. Laughing, we sheepishly pleaded ignorance to our server, who responded with a wide smile and a very INTIMATE demonstration. She tore a piece off of the flat bread, called injera, and used it to scoop up several of the stewed veggetable mixtures on our platter. Without skipping a beat, she had my head back, mouth open and was placing that morsel of goodness right into my pie hole. I kid you not. And WHAT a morsel! After seeing what a kick we got out of this, she repeated the process with my friend, with good humour and with the efficent, no-nonsense manner of your own Auntie. We couldn't have hoped for a more entertaining first bite of Ethiopian. 

Everything on the platter was delicious: there were two portions of a spicy spread, a warm spinach mixture, stewed lentils, something similar to warm curried hummus, and a tasty garlicy salad in the middle. It was PLENTY of food for two, and we both left stuffed and happy (especially after we paid; two beers and the platter came to around $25!)

Warm atmosphere, friendly service, delicious food and a price that lights me up inside. I see African Palace becoming a regular spot for this new member of Dufferin Grove.",1,Zk95TMXDx0zMUhYq5u8pxw

You get to go in and choose your type of BBQ sauce to put on your meat.  My husband and I each got pulled pork sandwiches with different BBQ sauces.  

What a disappointment!  Like one reviewer said, I wanted to love it but it was not very good.  The pork was incredibly dry and had a weird, greasy consistency at the same time.  My mac and cheese side was really mushy and not very flavorful.  It was a really disappointing experience.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?

I'm much more comfortable in spots like the Happy Dog, Now That's Class, and the Beachland... places where rowdiness reigns in bursts. I enjoy standing and getting amped up at the right times. The Supper Club is the inverse of this, so my perceived experience may be a little unfair because I went in knowing it was a half-step out of my comfort zone.

Though I admire how the venue has brought great artists like Robyn Hitchcock and Lucinda Williams back to Ohio, the food drastically needs some attention. The cider-based drink I received was fine but unspectacular. More importantly, the $12 Lobster Mac and Cheese wasn't worth a fourth of its price. Bland, soggy, and oddly textured, it seems like one of the menu's weakest points. My boyfriend ordered the sliders, which he also found mediocre. I also felt the entire selection was overpriced since there wasn't one item under $8.

Seeing as one has an assigned seat at a shared table, the famed ""date night"" may become awkward. The seating is cramped during a full show, and I didn't enjoy sitting right next to another couple on a night that was supposed to be a special one for myself and my significant other. This may be more of an issue of personal space, but it did affect my experience and I wish the setup had been less stiff.

There were small pros. The waitress we had was very sweet, and the view of the river is a definite perk. But these details do not make up for the lackluster, overly expensive food. My recommendation? Eat dinner elsewhere, then go to the show.",2,uZagZ5GCvNU58yAiIjMaxQ

Finally they brought out the same cut up steak that had obviously been just thrown back on the grill, the manager, Josh asked the rest of us who were finished if we wanted dessert, which we declined so he said since we didnt wany his free dessert, he would take 15% off the one entree (not the entire bill). The waitress came back a few minutes later and asked how the steak now was, which we told her was dried out from being re-cooked. The manager, Josh, came back to our table looking highly irritated and asked us what was wrong with the steak now, which we told him it was dried out from being thrown back on the grill after already being cut up. Josh was visibly irritated and told us 'Well I will take the whole thing off the bill then' and walked away - obviously irritated that he had to take the whole thing off the bill.

I usually get the caesar wrap with taters and gravy - always a good combo but they really need to start drying off the lettuce before they put it in the wrap because often, the wrap is soggy and dripping from the bottom. Not as bad lately though. We also always add on a chicken pop-ins. They're SOOOO damned good, you can't NOT have the whole container of these.

I went here with my gf and a couple of my friends and we chilled on the second floor outside by the patio. It had an awesome view of Downtown Fremont (Las Vegas). I can see the big difference between Old Vegas and New Vegas and I prefer the Old Vegas, because club admission isn't like $40-$50 per person, especially for gentlemen. Instead, it was $20, pretty moderate and it is Sin City for a reason. I know they have a rooftop bar on top of Inspire Bar, I haven't checked it out, but my friends told me it was really crowded and it was hard to even walk or even dance on the rooftop. The drinks are usually $6 for beers and $10 - $12 for certain alcoholic drinks like cranberry and vodka and etc. It reminds me of DTF. Just wish there was more people crowded on the 1st and 2nd Floor. So far, the place is getting better.

Invariably, the services comes at a cost of ambiance or service.  Not so Gen.  they've stepped up their game by offering a massive 36 item menu for an AYCE - reasonably priced at $21.99.

Their premium steak is served in 12-16 oz cuts 1/2 in thick.  All the fixins you can expect from a Korean BBQ.

The ambiance is bathed in blue hues - we'll have to come back at night instead of dusk.  Service is over the top.  As you'll have guessed, I am impressed by the sixth sense good servers have - realizing before you do, that you've finished your pop or need a refill of bean paste.

Special mention goes out to Prince, who did just that.  Have I mentioned that their hosts announce party size and the line cooks cheer?

The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.

You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!

We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.

It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.

And don't dare divert your attention, because if you aren't ready when a bag comes flying out the window, you know that shit's hitting the ground.

They finish shoving the metaphorical thorny 12-inch dildo up your ass by giving you an order of cold rubbery fries prepared sometime during the Clinton administration that only half-way fill the little container, a Snack Wrap with extra lettuce when you ordered it without, and a smaller-than-wanted Coke that syrup forgot to enrich.

You'll really want to take all that shit back and return it, because you got just ripped off faster than the arms on a meathead's new t-shirt.

I rarely play craps anymore. These days I like to play roulette. If you like roulette, this is your place!  The minimum bet is $1, a mere fraction of anywhere else. And they have .10 cent chips, so you can bet like crazy and have all kinds of fun. 

This casino is sort of an on the job training venue for the Boyd gaming company.  The employees are always engaging and helpful.  It is a pleasure to play here.

I ordered the Cinnamon crumble pancakes l very easy order. When the food came out my mom got a fajita omelet with a ton of things she can't eat. We told the waitress about it and she got nasty with us and said ""Well, the manager said this is how it comes"" and did not offer to take it back and fix the very simple omelet my mom asked for. It was made clear that we were SOL. Then my food came the eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns were very good no issues there. My pancakes came out, I ordered the featured Cinnamon crumble pancakes.

I asked to speak to the manager and when she eventually came over she was already annoyed.

Then she did tell us that our food would be free after giving us an attitude. When she picked up my pancakes to take them back we found a big black hair on my food, I have very short hair and my mom has short blonde hair so it wasn't ours.When that was also pointed out to the manager she literally huffed and stormed away.

They were already paying to leave but it still took the bartender a while to get our drink orders. 
After that we waited a while longer to be able to put in our food order. We got our chips n salsa after about 8 minutes of waiting, which is fine but really, there was two tables on the main floor and the other server kept hiding somewhere in the back. People at the table had to come up to the bar to ask for their check. 

After we got our food a guy came in and the server was too busy talking to him to pay attention to anyone else. My husband just wanted another beer. My mojito has no alcohol in it. I would know, I'm a 110 pound light weight who usually can only handle one drink since I become bright red and semi drunk, the drink just tastes like sour juice and sugar, I didn't even get a light buzz or redness.

As I mentioned before, the pho was not that bad but it comes down to the customer service. It's obviously a family owned business and with that being said they think they can get away with racist remarks and being unprofessional to their customers. 

I called an order in for pick up and upon arriving to the desk the cashier who made it clear she was the owner's daughter was having an unprofessional conversation with a customer. She looked to me and said ""Um, can I help you?"" I told her I was picking up and she replies ""Picking up what?"" After I told her she asked me if I spoke with her or her mother on the phone which I replied that I wasn't sure and she made a joke about Asian accents while the other customer and I just stood there. She said she can get away with it because she's Asian and white people like us can't because it's considered racist. 

It's so stupid to have to even explain how unprofessional and dumb you look representing your family's business. The girl just seemed like she had a lot of pent up aggression. Last time I come here. It's just too mind numbing to deal with.",1,CRF5c-Vo90Ulzd2vJhuprQ

I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.

This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.

Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.

Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.

Laugh as you leave and look across the street at Top Shelf.  You'll $20 richer and a good bit happier than if you went there",1,wWIwGPQs0P7Xtx_5Zp5cag

I usually go into a salon with a general length in mind, but not specific style. (Keep in mind I never color my hair, and usually only get a shampoo and cut.)

When I go into Beauty Brands I often get mixed feelings about their customer service. I've had my hair cut by Esther and others, and all of my haircuts have been great. But the women at the welcome desk always seem rushed and displeased to see me. They rudely reminded me that their welcome desk was not the desk to pay (the one at the register is). They don't even 'hold' the phone when you have a question.

As for the cut itself, I am low-maintenance and I get a few inches cut off and re-layered. Esther was a great girl who was able to understand my needs and answer any questions I may have. The only thing I dislike when I go is the fact they make me take off my glasses and I can't see what they're doing. I've been to other salons where they don't make me remove them, and do my hair in smaller sections. I suppose I don't have much to complain about at the price they charge, but it is one thing I've been bothered by.

They have pretty good deals on purchases of products in bulk. My favorite leave-in conditioner can be bought in large bottles for a lower price than I'd find at salons or try to find in stores. I can appreciate their supply of nail products, but have never purchased their polishes.

In short, if you're looking for an economical, standard haircut-- Beauty Brands is a great place.",2,ulWw2bYBAAhqiOmbrhSKfA

So apparently you can't book for two people at the same time for a service that takes literally a minute and a half. First frustration, I try to do this and am told that instead I will have to book a second appointment. Ok, fine.  So I do. I arrive on appointment day and explain that if I can't get in at same time as my partner that I needed to cancel the 11:45a that you required me to book because I do not have the time. Instead of accomodating me for a minute and a half service (yes I mention again). We arrived early for check-in for the original appointment I had requested at 11:15a. We waited 11 minutes past the first appointment time. I find it unreasonable that they could not accommodate two people for the same service in 11 minutes. At 11:26a, they call my bf back. At 11:29a he's done and back out. We leave.


I get a call at 11:55 from Kimberley asking me if I was running late, I don't know if she gets confused easily or what, maybe she forgot the interaction 25 minutes earlier. I tell her that they couldn't fit me in and remember i cancelled the 11:45a appointment when I was in at 11:10a. She started on some crazy stuff about ""well our cancellation policy... blah blah"" I hung up, are you serious?

What a hidden gem! I've driven by this location numerous times and never thought to drop in but I sure am I glad I did today!

I ordered online using the yelp EAT app and headed to the North Hills Grill. So convenient. Only word of caution: the EAT app is not most up to date on what delicious items they have to offer.

The establishment is so clean and the lady behind the counter was very nice. She made sure my food to go wouldn't leak or spill by double checking for me. Such attention to detail!

Now to the food...

Wow wow wow. Honestly, I didn't expect such a high quality gourmet salad. (I got the berry salad with blue cheese, grilled chicken and almonds) it was delightful. The berries were fresh and plentiful. Not haphazardly thrown in just for color... A true generous amount. And the dressing tasted homemade and was a perfect blend of sweet, tart and savory. I also got the stuffed pepper soup which was so hearty but not gross-greasy if you know what I mean. Very flavorful. I ate every last morsel. 

Check this place out. It is one of those places where you will see hard working people putting out high quality food with lots of attention and pride.",2,zTCwJg0hPY_cb3vWY0XMbg

There used to be a whole section with an awesome selection of soups and salads. Now the soups and salads are scattered all over the place. Veggies in one section, greens in another. I like starting my meals with a big salad and soup, and don't like having to trek all over the buffet to find all my fixins. There is also less selection of pasta salads, and no ambrosia.

Also, as a local, we used to get 2 for 1. Now it's 25% off. I know Caesars is going through some financial challenges but don't take it out on the locals! We're the ones who recommend places to our out of town friends and who take them to your properties. 
The food quality is actually pretty decent and the desserts are amazing. But it's not worth the high price.

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out the New York Striploin at the Keg today. Our waiter said it is their best steak so I have to give this one a try!

I asked for a medium cooked steak, and surprisingly that's what I got! I was initially worried that they may have overcooked it as a lot of places do, but the meat was tender throughout and I enjoyed the whole experience. The fries were pretty good too and I like how they have some peas to balance the meal.

The service was really good. We got a coat check walking into the restaurant, fancy! Our food came relatively fast and our waiter kept visiting regularly to pour us more water and to check on our meals. He even asked us if we wanted to have separate cheques right off the bat before ordering. He should get a promotion haha.

The steak costed $35 for 12 ounces if I recall correctly. For Toronto standards that is quite average. And for how much I enjoyed the steak, I'd be willing to pay that price for sure!

All in all, food was great, service was awesome, and I really enjoyed my time here. Would definitely try it again in the future. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!",0,vX_GHesdmyjEQWTQWHRScg

For an entree, I'd stick to the fish and chips rather than some of the other offerings. My husband did not care for the fish tacos ($12) which he ordered off of the specials board. He found them to be pretty bland. I've tried both the cod ($8 for one piece) and the haddock ($8.50 for one piece) fish and chips, they are satisfying, not too greasy.

Other reviews complain about Sea being expensive. As I mentioned above, some portions may seem small for the price but I wouldn't call it expensive.

The decor includes props from the steel era in Pittsburgh, and a nice stone and wood interior.  The interior of the bar and restaurant are opened to the outdoor air on nice days. Unfortunately, my experience didn't match the ambiance.

The service here is one of two stories. Our first bartender only acknowledged us when we first arrived. We ordered a beer and a vodka cranberry, which we received with our first order. The well drink had a weak pour. After that, we were not acknowledged for the next 20 minutes. The next bartender Wendel, was fantastic, stopping by frequently to check on what we needed as customers. In general, it seemed like most of the service staff distracted one another by holding side conversations and horseplay. Considering the place wasn't busy during our stop here, we were disappointed by the initial lack of service.

One of the shining inventions at this bar is the ""Yinzerita."" A margarita with a beer of your choice poured inside. The beer doesn't add anything special to the flavor of the margarita. However, it is an extremely novel drinking concoction. As a part of visiting here, everyone should have one.

We also ordered a ""Plain Jane"" pizza while we were here. We got the larger of the two pizzas they offered and it is the size of a regular bar pie you would find at most restaurants. The pizza had a thin crust, bitter sauce, and regular cheeses. It took around 40 minutes to deliver the order. Based on the size of the pie, it should have taken a lot less. Overall, I was disappointed in the delivery and taste of the pie.",2,MZuvl0oUK3QSv7faGx9i5w

The rooms are classy, very modern, very clean, and spacious.

The rooms were clean, updated and contemporary. I say rooms as we partied in several over the weekend. Rooms consist of a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette and living room. The living room was large enough to handle  a couple Euchre games.

Both the living room and the bedroom had large flat panel LCD TVs. 

The hotel lobby has a little river running though it stocked with Turtles. Both small and large, they seemed to delight the college athletes and their siblings. I counted 18 of them in one pond. 

Much appreciated was the evening Manager's Reception (aka. free happy hour) from 5:30 to 7:30 each night. Eric, the bartender, made darn good Margaritas... I gave him plenty of opportunity to practice ;-) 

Their complementary hot breakfast was outstanding. This wasn't some typical pastry, bagels and cereal (although they had that). Breakfast included hot eggs, bacon, sausage along with made-to-order pancakes, waffles, french toasts and omelets. I had a kitchen sink omelet and it was fantastic.

Ask a kid if she wants marshmallows and cinnamon on her applesauce? Please tell Mom and Dad It'll cost them.

*RAMEN BREAKDOWN*

BROTH: It was good, but not the best. It sort of lacked a richness and complexity that I'm accustomed to. 4/5

NOODLES: They were thin straight noodles. Pretty good. 4/5

EGG: Leaning towards the soft-boiled spectrum of boiled eggs. It tickled my fancy. 4.5/5

CHASHU: Okay so I rarely ever have Chashu cut so thinly, but wow that shit just straight up melted in my mouth. ACTUALLY, usually it just melted away as I was trying to pick it up with my chopsticks, but if it ever made it to my mouth still intact, it melted away, like BUTTA. 4.5/5

PRESENTATION: Beautiful. 5/5

SERVICE
The servers were pretty, attentive, polite, and knowledgeable. I'm not sure if they were Japanese though, but they both did have accents. I don't care about that anyway. They're everything you look for in servers.

ATMOSPHERE
Looks just like a Shinsengumi in terms of the layout and that's a good thing. Well, the Shinsengumi by my house, at least.

I approve of this ramen joint, but if I'm going to Las Vegas again, I might skip it so that I can try all the other wonderful Japanese restaurants around. Nothing personal though! I'd recommend it!",5,jZR83eAD3eMYvQ1lMooMdA

LhiLLMXHq8KvGSVib16zKA,0,2015-07-22 21:30:35,0,uv5TBGcwQc3Pamcv20qkCw,2,"I really wanted to like Corbeaux. I have visited maybe once every month and a half since it opened on 17th.

 The concept is nice (and so's the massive skylight pouring natural light over the tables and walls) but at the same time it's all over the place. I visit 17th ave a lot and the building's exterior is pretty imposing; its spaciousness is reflected inside the building, but is taken advantage of pretty terribly. The layout itself is confusing, with dining tables on one side of a divider and a counter where you can order baked goods. I'm never sure where you're allowed to sit, so it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to blend the line between an all-purpose hangout place and a formal dining experience. I might try having dinner there one day, but I don't know - it never really appealed to me as a restaurant, so I never think about going there exclusively for a sit-down meal.

If you go to Corbeaux to study, you're basically relegated to the stools by the windows, which is not actually the best feeling, even though it's basically the same thing as Analog. The first few times I went when it opened, it seemed like a fledgling operation, trying to find it's feet - the cashiers by the baked goods were inexperienced and it took forever just to get a chocolate eclair. Having the cashier also handling all of the retrieving, sandwich-warming and whatnot all while managing the till is really inefficient and it definitely makes you feel impatient just watching. Though the eclair itself was good, I don't get a hampering for sweets and their sandwiches often enough to go regularly. 

I don't think Corbeaux is the coolest thing that ever was - the execution is actually quite confusing and I have no idea what the areas/stools at the back are for. It just seems like a lot of wasted space and it could be more cohesive. 

In terms of the food I've tried, the cookies were okay, but didn't seem that fresh. I like eggplants, so got an eggplant sandwich. It was VERY oily, leaking all over my hands and was definitely inconveniencing when I had to get up from my stool and walk straight up to the cashier to try to find paper napkins. They were pretty judge-y about that (I'm sry???? my hands are covered in oil someone help). The sweets are high quality, macaroons slightly disappointing... but overall, just not a phenomenal experience for what it appears to offer.",1,IxyaUNAmczHplQmiN6m8Jw

Everything they serve comes with a glistening sheen of butter, which makes everything delicious and rich, and makes for a bit of heartburn later. Not the worst thing ever.

They make an extremely good steak, perfectly cooked. Their ingredients are excellent. Admittedly I tend to be there just about closing time, but I always get the impression that they can't decide if they are a fine dining establishment or a sports bar where the waitstaff would rather go home than deal with me. 

Their steak salad with home fries and grilled onions means the potatoes, onions and sliced steak are on top of the salad. With butter. So all these delicious components don't quite work as a protein on a salad. I know Pittsburgh is famous for potatoes on sandwiches, but it's just an odd layer to work though.

Their steak sandwich and open faced steak sandwich are exactly what it says: a steak sitting on top of a slice of bread. Absolutely delicious, but not something I would pick up with my hands and eat. 

Having said all that, the food is well made and they close late. The servers are nice enough without being solicitous, and they haven't turned me away yet.",1,538pVFWMOaaRbmW0AXZy4Q

I was able to enrol in the Puppy Socialization class which was an incredibly easy process. Caryn makes it possible to pay for classes online as well as manage your schedule online. So the flexibility of the courses was a really great feature for us as our schedule is very inconsistent. 

We're graduated now but our experience here was memorable to say the least! The puppy social class offered exactly what it stated. The room was very clean and well organized. The instructors were very helpful in answering our questions about my puppies behaviour issues I had been experiencing. Caryn is extremely sweet and you can tell she really loves what she does! The male instructor (Sean I believe his name was?) was one of our favourites! He always seemed to have the perfect treat for our puppy that made her pretty much grovel at his feet!!!!!! Something I thought she'd never have the attention span to do! All instructors had a very pleasant demeanour and seem knowledgable even to your specific breed (impressive)! They gave me a great feel on what to expect when my basset was able to go into the real world and how to encourage good behaviour. 

The only complain I would make would be about the facility itself.. It's very industrial and I'd like them to be able to expand their business into something maybe more inviting?

I explained that I used Roku and Hulu for my TV.  I was told that Spectrum would like to offer me a free month of their app, for people who use Roku.  I asked if it was really free and was told yes.  I then said, do I have to cancel the service?  I was told by Patrick, ""no, it will drop off and you do not need to cancel.""  I said, are you sure?  I don't want to find this on my bill.  Patrick assured me it would not show on my bill.  Guess what?  Yep, it is on my bill and I cannot cancel it online.  I have to CALL in to get it removed.

Now, let's talk about tech service.  When I arrived home with my box, I attempted to set up the app on my Roku but I kept getting this error message.  When I called for help, I was place on hold several times.  The rep had no idea what the error message and error code I received meant.  I was on the phone for 45 min, before I told her to just call me back when it is corrected.  Guess what?  Yep, no call back.  About a week later, I tried the app again and it started to work.

The service connection to my home cuts off from time to time.  I called once again for help.  I was told the service to my home is very weak and someone will need to come out to address the issue.  I'll have to catch you up later on this one.

All in all, if I had a choice.  I'd go with someone other than Spectrum.  Customer Service is an unknown concept for this company.",1,tVa5hdF_z4LcHbRThtqXFQ

We went this evening, May 4, 2016 and were happy to see a mostly full restaurant.  We ordered our usual queso dip and ""Fajitas Valarta"" for 2.  The first sign something was a little off was the queso.   I commented that it was runny.  Ok, maybe it's just the way the batch was made, move on, right?

Next the fajitas for 2 came out sizzling just like it always does.  This time however, the plate featured LOTS of peppers and onions sizzling and little else.  There were 5 or so shrimp, like always, but very little in the way of beef or chicken.  Very little.  

I actually called the waiter over and asked if this is how the dish is made now.  He said that they have cut the portions but it did seem small.  He took it to the kitchen and was quickly turned around.  He apologized and said that this is how the dish is now served.  We said ok and just stared at it - stuck in that moment where you decide if you're going to take one for the team and eat or roll.  We decided we'd eat and just not return, lesson learned.  However, as I sat there for another minute or two I was so disgusted that I decided to portion out the chicken and beef.  In doing so we determined we had about 2oz of chicken and maybe 2 oz of beef to go with our 5 shrimp.  This is for a ""fajitas for 2"" combo, mind you.  I should have taken a picture of the beef and chicken separated out but the waiter took it back before I thought to do it.  He again apologized and we politely told him we wouldn't be back if this is the new reality.

I'm thinking that without the revenue a liquor license would generate that the Casa can't make the margins they need to survive.  It's a pity because it was previously a nice place considering the quality of the food and portions.  Take that away though and you have just another restaurant operator trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  Hasta La Vista, Casa Nayarit.",3,s_nZfqbREuLDcH0CWQ1yaw

I got the lamb kebab in a roti which was pretty good, i thought the roti was a bit too soft so i would probably go for the naan next time.  The meal was $10.15 for just the wrap which at first I thought was a bit pricey but, I literally ate it for 3 different meals so not bad value if you look at it like that.

They also have a lot of nice sauces like mint chutney and curry sauce that you can add on to your food.

The currently location used to be two stores. The wall was knocked down. Facing the doors as if you are going into the bakery, the right side has plenty of tables and chairs where you can sit there and sip your milk tea at your leisure or chow down on your food item purchases. The left side of the store has a ton of baked goods, a section that serves hot food, and the cashier area. 

I tend to buy tons of buns, cake, and dessert items. I have yet to fetch a hot meal here. I will someday!

The buns are smaller in size, which I like. You can eat more than one bun without feeling guilty and you can sample nor flavours. I love the steamed buns, such as the mushroom and pork, and barbeque pork. You can also get baked buns, such as the curry beef and yummy chicken. 

Don't forget dessert! I love the sticky coconut balls with peanut filling. I also like the green tea Swiss roll, savoury bacon and green onion roll, and mango coconut cake. Yummy all around. 

This bakery only accepts cash. Service is quick and friendly.

We really were impressed with this place- I think it is totally flying under the radar for how solid it is. We will definitely be back but hope the menu changes up every once in awhile as there aren't a whole lot of options. 

My one suggestion- educate your servers about gluten allergies- it's a pretty common question, especially in fine dinging and my server had absolutely no idea what gluten even was.",0,pTGVqTpsPffvwII5EsGvaw

I've been attending for over a year and actually left another local studio to come here. The difference was night and day. We didn't get the run around for 3 weeks just learning how to stand NEXT to the pole. We learned 3 tricks THE FIRST DAY!

Lindsay prioritizes every student of every class. She also allows us to record ourselves and our dances in choreo which makes it fun to share our progress on social media and with our friends. Most studios are a little too strict or too weird when it comes to this and Prowess is ALL ABOUT safety, privacy, and fun. If for any reason any of us is uncomfortable, we make sure we angle our cameras away from whoever doesn't want to be a part of the video.

We also get quarterly events/ performances where we can show what we've learned if we want to and family and friends are invited.

I had a Grilled Crêpe with Bananas, Caramel and Chocolate Ice Cream. This was fantastic. I do believe if I had eaten beforehand I would not have been able to finish it. The size was reasonable and worth the every penny. To quench my thirst I had a White Hot Chocolate which was rich but nice. I was confused as the hot chocolate was given to me in a bowl type cup and the cream in a separate bowl. I just drank from it anyway (turns out that's what you were supposed to do). I did end up having the cream with the Crêpe.

The atmosphere was nice. The furniture was comfortable and the place was a good size. A great colour scheme and you could see from the counter how they make the hot chocolate quite interesting actually. All Dark, Milk, White etc..

Signage is difficult to spot (and none of it's lighted). They offer valet parking (it's Summerlin!) You don't have to valet, just be prepared to walk 100 feet to the entrance. 

VG has solid menu options ranging from filet to risotto and even octopus. They're open for lunch M-F & dinner every day. The cocktail and wine menus have been changing regularly and that is a plus. Their popular cocktail offerings vary from a blueberry crush to a champagne cocktail. The variety of wines is extensive, so they live up to their name. I can usually find something new to try even after being here too many times to remember. 

They have a Lounge Menu with smaller sized snacks such as a margherita flatbread, crab cake and shrimp cocktail.  I recommend trying their cheese & meat boards (known to some as charcuterie). I've tried the boar salami and smoked duck with Stilton blue cheese. Tasty! They also have more flatbread options such as Italian sausage with burrata cheese. Thursday has been live music night and the place can be quite busy for that.

Plus it doesn't feel nearly as crazy busy as the Mandalay pools. I would definitely stay here during the summers.

Dinners are around $14. The portions are generous. Comes with a soup or salad, the salads come on a medium sized plate, not some tiny side plate.

The ice water tasted fine. (I'm picky about my water!)

Here's the background.  We decided to have a wedding party at our house this Summer, since our wedding was a private one in the Keys.  We spent a lot of time scheduling and planning this party, and several of our family members flew across the country to attend.

I suppose I should have known better, but what can I say?  We decided to go with Hy-Vee's catering service as they had a nice-looking menu and brochure, and the store manager (Lucas Glasgow) assured us that Stephanie's catering department is second-to-none.

Here's how the catering process was communicated to us.  First, we were to choose from a basic menu (we chose barbecue), and then could add the sides that we wanted.  Having done that, we were informed that Stephanie would call us the week before to confirm the number of guests and if any particulars had changed.  Great.

Unfortunately, Stephanie never called us back!  Being very concerned, we visited the catering department to make sure our service was still scheduled.  The first time, we were simply told that Stephanie was out, and to try back the next day.  My wife did check back the next day:  Stephanie was gone on vacation, returning after our party.  Not that this is a problem; we certainly understand vacations and as long as a backup is in place, there's really no concern.

Upon our 3rd visit, we discovered there was really no backup.  This is now Friday, the day before our party!!!  My wife, being the wonderful and reliable person that she is, went to find someone in the market since the service desk was completely unhelpful.  And indeed she did find someone, who was preparing our barbecue.  That's right:  cooking the meat the night before.  Now, anyone who knows barbecue can tell you that's NOT a good sign.

The party comes.  All the guests are assembled and having a very good time.  Hy-Vee shows up, and sets up the barbecue and sides on our kitchen bar.  Upon opening up the meats, it's clear they are overcooked and dry.  Completely terrible; tough, dried out meats that are difficult to even chew through.  Our guests, being the kindhearted and gracious people that they are, never complained to us of course.  But we were mortified.  It seriously ruined our party for us -- the very special day that we painstakingly planned for months.  Afterwards, we received a $100 discount (after some haggling), but that's not the point is it?

Please.  If you are considering Hy-Vee's catering, I respectfully ask you to re-consider.  We don't want this to happen to anyone else.  I wouldn't have taken the time to write this unless I was completely devastated by something.  Maybe you will get lucky, I don't know.  But if you hire these people, you are playing with fire.",10,zLQLIbLlD3SDdNzvrUqCGQ

I went after it was open for only 4 days, and my meal was excellent but not quite perfect. I am pretty picky at expensive restaurants, and none of the minor flaws were things that would prevent me from returning. I had the hamachi crudo with crispy potatoes -- if each bite had a little of every garnish (especially the tiny lightly spicy pepper) it was delicate and delicious. But if the bite missed any of the many small elements on the dish, then it lacked seasoning. I also had manila clams which were delicious, light with a wonderful broth -- but there was a little grit in the broth. And I also had a half order of agnolotti with a pea sauce with shaved truffles. The flavor was absolutely out of this world, but it arrived at the same time as the clams, and the truffle was too strong to eat alongside the light clams.The housemade pasta was a little TOO al dente for my taste, but I understand that many chefs believe in leaving a ""bite"" to noodles and risotto that isn't to my taste. I was concerned the pasta would get cold if I ate it last, but it was just fine. So, a small plate, an antipasti and a 1/2 primi plus a nice glass of white wine ran me $70 with tip.

A whole lobster but the only meat in the lobster was in the claws, there was no meat in the rest of the lobster at all, not even the tail. It looked like someone else dug into this pot before I did. I complained to the manager and got a new lobster for my efforts but no crab or shrimp.

My guest ordered the King Crab bucket. Again, it looked like her food was picked over as well. 2 of her crab legs were cracked and had no meat in them. Another complaint to the manager. However with this we received no compensation and just a ""That happens some times"".

So after we finished what turned out to be half of the food that we ordered we waited 20 minutes to look for someone to get our bill. Finally the manager returned with the full bill, no apologies, no credits, not even a coupon for the next visit. I expressed to the manager our dissatisfaction with the meal and service only to receive a reply of ""I'm sorry to hear that"" as she was walking away from us.

Needless to say we will not be returning.

This was the worst restaurant experience that I've had in several years.",5,wzlZli3EVOPF0MDYwqvzdw

And it's a birthday, not like we are just bringing our own dessert for the heck of it.  We decided not to do it.

We order probably $200 worth of food and drinks and asked if we could have 3 rolls to come with our dinner.  No big deal right?  WRONG!  Our server came back and says they have 5 left for someone that may come in for a sandwich and will not accommodate us with any rolls and did not offer for us to purchase a couple.  Basically, you get what you get and you don't get upset.

Food was nothing more than okay especially after them not making any reasonable accommodations for us.

So, just like the name states, you have 9 rounds to complete in 30 minutes.  Each round is 3 minutes and there is a 30 second ""active rest"" inbetween rounds.  Each round combines cardio, core and strength so you are ensured a total body workout.  This is somewhat of a ""kickboxing fusion"" concept so at a few of the rounds you put your boxing gloves on and go to town on a punching bag!  It is actually quite refreshing and a great way to release tension after a long day at work!  

The stations change every day so you are constantly ""tricking"" your body which is a great way to see results.  You will  see a variety of moves like jump roping, squats, burpees, planks, roundhouse kicks, various punches, pushups, dips, etc

This is a great place for all fitness levels.  The trainers challenge you along the way or they can modify if you have any injuries.

My hair felt like mozzarella cheese after he finished!!!  He burned my scalp & he  calls himself a fine hair specialist... the color has no panache, let's talk about the hair cut! He didn't even know how to pull the hair up to cut layers, all the time just staring in the mirror looking at himself!!!! If you want a nice scalp massage or shampoo I recommend you pass he barely put any shampoo in my hair, you could shampoo your own head better than he does...know idea how he received his cosmetology license.

So I was starving today and needed a place to eat. I have heard rave things about Weiss so I though ""I'll give this place a shot!"" I did just that!

I called a fee times to place my order over the phone considering I had to return to work. They never answered even though they were open. So I hopped my little but in the car and went for a drive. I arrived at this little Deli in between a art supply store and a  hair salon. Wasn't anything to be desires by the curb appeal. I entered and it appeared as if I time wrapped to the early 1990s but I digress! I placed my order, paid and waited....and waited...and waited...then waited some more. My food finally after nearly 25 minutes came to me wrapped in a typical plastic bag and screamed to be eaten! (Insert horror flic screams here!) I ordered the Latkes with Brisket and cheese. A first time meal for me,and was looking forward to it! I rushed to work, opened the package and scarfed my first gooey delish bite of pure bliss! I couldn't stop eating it! I kept shoveling the food in my mouth like a starving child! (Or a fat kid in front of cake!)

Firstly, the decor is awful. It looks as if someone went crazy at IKEA to select the furnishings. Guys - your competition in this neighbourhood is steep, you need to invest in proper furniture and lighting. Give up all the candles, it doesn't work when the chairs are hard as rocks and look bargain basement. Don't pour water using plastic jugs, this isn't lunch hour at the local junior high school.

Secondly, the service needs a shake-up. The gals working that evening sauntered around and acted as if they were doing you a favour to serve you. Save the attitude for when you're out at the bar on your own time, not when I'm paying over $100 to be there. 

Thirdly, the food. Bottom line, don't bother with food because you're clearly phoning it in. Focus your time and attention on good wine (which was decent) and some charcuterie / cheeses. Your menu simply isn't accurate and the quality is awful. Again your competition is blowing you away here.

I like the concept of a wine bar that focuses on good wine, good service and good atmosphere. Integrate your name and brand into those three things and do it well, then I'll return.",3,gW4UsZSf81Xqc29eE2yqCg

The woman who took my order had this guilty look on her face, and said my drink had been ready for a while and that her partner had called is out ""several times.""

First thing first, the brioches w 2types  of spread, spicy refried beans and the most insane butter spread. So flavorful!  Maybe because we were so hungry?  Nope, I tried it again after I was semi-full, and still at awe by it. Yum yum yum. Here are the things we ordered: 
-red sangria (yum and fruity, I was so peenk!!! Asian genes *_*)
-clams (fresh and have lots of flavor, w chunks oh goat cheese)

The ambiance is nice (although the country music channel their TV is stuck on is a little strange) and the service is good, but... the food was just so terrible that I can't give anything more than a 1 Star rating. 

Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and Silver Noodle soup, along with an egg roll appetizer. The egg rolls were decent, if a little oily - sadly, that was the best bite I had of the evening. Everything else was just so greasy, oily, and relatively tasteless, that I could only stand eating the food for the first 2 minutes. After that, the piping-hot temperature that was making the food half-bearable gave way to terrible lack of taste and an inedibly slimy texture for everything. We all agreed that it was a pretty bad food night. 

This has to be one of the first times that I didn't finish the food at a restaurant - I usually finish my entree, and if I don't, I always make sure to take the leftovers home. But not this time, which is a minor anti-miracle in my food-universe. I didn't take anything home from our evening at Corner Thai, besides a bad taste in the mouth and a bit of pity for the nice server who had to listen to that country music station all day.

I asked the girl if they had chimichangas she said yes and said they are a good size so in my mind it will take almost the whole plate because that's what I'm use to at other Mexican restaurants when it came it looked like a frozen burrito from the store that they heated up. The prices for the food they serve you is not worth paying full price for. Plus side of this place is they are family owned and the family is very nice.

I placed a takeout order for the creamy ramen and it was ready about 10 minutes later (about the time it took me to get there).

In all - I was really pleased.  The ramen was packaged to go really well.  The broth was in one container and all of the noodles, veg, and meat were in a second container.  The ONLY downside to this is that one of the containers needed to be a little larger as I couldn't fit everything into a single bowl.  I'm not even taking a star away for that, because it was really good.

The noodles had an excellent texture, the veggies were fresh and crisp, the meat was very flavorful... and they managed to package an egg to go that stayed soft-boiled.  I killed it on my own by pouring the broth over it -- but that was me.

The bowl of ramen was hot and filling.  It kept me happy all afternoon.  Even better was the price.  $8.95 plus tax.  I was very pleased - the cost was for a complete bowl of ramen and they didn't try to upcharge me for every little thing.

I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:
I visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior. I would like confirmation that Dr. Baig has been made aware of this situation and hopefully reprimanded for how the situation unfolded.

I will be posting this on as many public forums as possible. This was unacceptable from a mental health provider.",9,hqdZnBTmIsVsDrLUiUaF0w

We have tried every Korean place within 10m miles of our house (which, luckily for us, is really close to Chuhgajib) and this is by far our favorite.

Whether we have a craving for something specific or even something off the menu, we are never disappointed.

It's a bit pricier than food in Korea, but it's oh-so-yummy! The owners are wonderfully friendly, and the place reminds me of a place my husband and I called home for a long time. It makes me miss the all night sojo binges followed by a noraebang (karaoke).

My husband loves Haemul Tang (Seafood soup) and my fav is the bulgogi you grill at the table.

I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.

In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6. 

I am one of those who misses the tastes offered by Istanbul Grill. Istanbul Grill was offering the similar gyro sandwich & fries even for more: $9.

We had them clear the line which fixed the problem temporarily until the same problem start again a little while ago. We called Cobra Rooter to come out and give us a quote and second opinion. The owner, Jerry, came out right away and looked at the pipe that had been uncovered previously. He said he would start by clearing the clog and then see if a patch was possible. The next day he was able to clear the clogged drain and did a really nice patch of the pipe for only $280. He did quality work at an extremely fair price. It's nice to find someone who is honest and hard working. We will be only using Cobra Rooter from now on and will be referring anyone who needs a plumber to check them out. Jerry and his company saved us thousand and did a stellar job on the repair.",1,rEVQNGzVgjKzExRGU6Zrlg

After booking on Priceline I was concerned about negative reviews on Yelp mostly concerning noise. We needn't have been concerned. We asked for, and were given a 5th floor room overlooking Clark street and experienced absolutely no disturbances either from the lounge or from other guests. 

Our room was spacious and very tastefully decorated. We loved the roomy shower and comfortable robes.  The common areas were full of striking touches and the staff was very pleasant. Housekeeping was timely and efficient.  

Since we are frequent visitors to Montreal, we already knew that the location would be ideal for us. We were located in easy walking distance from our favorite restaurant, L'Express, on the Plateau as well as from the jazz festival which has been our travel destination for the last 20 years or so.  

Looking forward to our next visit.

I can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...

we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. 
There is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.
We had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! 
The front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.

I searched online for Land Rover mechanic & found BIRKSHIRE Automobiles advertising as a Land Rover Dealer Alternative, I phoned them and I explained to them the situation, they told me that they had a Land Rover scanner and it will tell them the exact problem after they scan my car (more detailed report than the Regular mechanic generic scanner). I made the appointment and went there, They scanned the car and the same results that I already knew were on their diagnosis report, the only difference was in the bottom of the report it said: customer to Call US. they charged me 1 hour labour and they refused to refund me, they informed me that will contact their Tech team in England and try and figure out  what the problem is and will get back to me within 3 days!!!.

Wow, the apps were good and the mains were amazing. The sweet and bitter salad was really great; a great mix of the two flavours. The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.

I will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. 

The desserts were also very simple; not like ""awesome because it was so simple and amazing"", but like, ""just simple and meh"". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.

We sat on the patio, and it was really cute; birds singing, music playing, leaves and twigs falling on to our table, which made us giggle. The bee was pretty scary, but I seriously recommend the patio.

It's a two storey joint, but i think the majority of the books are on the main floor. The second floor I believe are for comic books and such.

One lady came when i started yelling excuse me (sorry to do that but nobody was willing to assist us before that) and when i asked to sit outside (i reached at 8 and there were still 2 hours to close) she told me they dont have enough servers and wont be able to serve outside.

First came the toasted bread with jelly, which was compliments of the chef. The jelly was smooth and mild. It wasn't sweet at all. More of a savory rich taste. There was something beneath the jelly which looks like peanut butter but tastes nothing like it. Perhaps it was almond butter? There was a complimentary bread that was nice and steamy when you broke it open. One of the best breads I have had at a restaurant.

I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare. Very juicy and great with the added butter. The chef also provided complimentary dessert. Brownie bites. So much complimentary appetizers and sweets that I didn't even order any. I am a stuffed animal now.

I grabbed the small chicken and shrimp burrito on brown and had two dots of hot sauce ( Some burrito assemblers have a heavy hand you know what I mean lol). Anyway I told the lady who was making my burrito for some extra guacamole and I forgot to pay for it. She was kind enough to say, "" I will try my best to put on a little extra for you"". I had that moment... ""Now that ladies and gentlemen is the real MVP."" My friend and I grabbed two pops and waited for roughly 10-15 minutes. The inside of this place is spacious and there's a lot of seating for all group sizes. Burrito Boyz uses a numbering system which matches your receipt so when you hear your number, you jump up for joy. Now, when I took the first bite, it was perfection and that lady totally hooked it up with the guac *tear rolls down cheek.

All the employees I interacted with were very pleasant and respectful. I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the Madame Croque. Both were absolutely amazing. I added a friend egg to my sandwich which made it even better in my opinion. 

Even the fries were really good. The turkey was fresh and the dijonaisse really added a good flavor. Everything is seasoned generously but I like seasoning but I can see how someone can think it's too much. 

The madame croque was out of this world. It's brioche bread with ham and gruyere cheese, a Parmesan crust on the brioche and an over easy egg on top. So simple but so good. It comes with a small side of brown mustard I believe and a couple mini pickles. I highly recommend this dish.

In a brief time, the server came out and took my order.  Since I had looked at the menu while waiting inside, I was ready to order.  I started out with lentil soup and followed this up with their chicken pesto panini.  I also got a caramel cappuccino. 

The soup was very good.  Hearty amounts of small chopped vegetables and lentils.  The panini was very good.  The menu describes it as: Grilled chicken with melted provolone, ripe tomatoes, crispy bacon and spinach--drizzled with pesto spread.  That's a good description.

Service was very good.  My server was also a very pleasant woman.  The only thing about which they have no control over is the noise from Rainbow Boulevard.

And sadly, that was the best part of the meal. The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle with no smile, short answers, and not friendly at all. She wasn't unfriendly, just like I said...a wet noodle. 

The chips and ""salsa"" came. We tried the hot, but the waitress was right in calling it smooth. It was blended, had little flavor, and was literally and figuratively cold. As if it was in a fridge. The regular salsa had little flavor as well.

Then came the menu which was set up nice until I saw the prices and the size. The prices were easily half again as most places with portions half the size of the better and cheaper restaurants. 

We got a ""bean and jalapeño"" dip that had no flavor whatsoever. We mixed in the ""hot"" sauce in an attempt to salvage it. It got a little better. 

So I ordered my usual go to at a new Mexican restaurant. Flautas with refried beans and rice. The rice was ok. The beans actually had good flavor, but the tiny little flautas were bad to the point of I just stopped eating anything all together. 

Then on top, they over charged me! 

This place was a disappointment and not worth your time and money. I would have done better with a bean and cheese burrito at a shady gas station! I suggest doing your pallet a favor and keep going down the road...",0,0nLgrXoKntxhGTeopuEWEg

The casino, pool, buffet & cirque show are top notch, but the rooms are not worth the spend. If you think the rooms will be just a cheery as the main floor, you're in for a shock. Very drab and no continuity with the colorful lobby. 
Stayed for work and barely slept...walls are paper thin and woke up at every roudy guest in the hall and airplane overhead...and the mattress was very firm. Each side of the bed gets 2 pillows but one of which is a euro, which is much too large to use so woke up with a stiff neck. Only had an outlet on one side of the bed so had to run for the alarm. Slight damage to the TV.   Shower had a bench built in which made it feel small.  
These may all seem like petty little things, but at $300/night, you can do better...for instance, I loved Mandalay Bay. 
However, the bath tub is the room at the Wynn's redeeming grace...amazing. And the view from the panoramic room is breathtaking.

This former Pizza Hut has limited seating, and we had to wait several minutes for a table at a relative early hour, although it was Happy Hour.  It seems like most of the crowd was local workers or residents with several larger groups; that didn't help with getting seated quickly. 

Once seated, we ordered beer off the fairly good selection of drafts. I will say that it seems they only make the draft list weekly and were out of a few things by the time we got there; a bit disappointing.  However, the beers were good and reasonably priced at Happy Hour.

We ordered an appetizer, and then ordered burgers. Unfortunately, the burgers came 5 minutes after the appetizer, even though we had ordered them well after the app.  The server/kitchen should have spaced this out better.  The burgers were delicious. I wouldn't call them gourmet, and certainly can't compete with several other burger places in Pittsburgh, but they were juicy and had great flavor. The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot, too. 

Our server was pretty good at the start, but she brought our check along with the food, and that was surprising, especially since we planned to drink more. We were able to flag her down to order more beer, but then she needed to reprint the check when we were ready to go. That coupled with the appetizer timing was a bit frustrating.

Service was good. The waiter was clearly knowledgeable about the menu and suggested adding spinach to the eggs Benedict when I was torn between the Benny and a spinach omelet.

Only pet peeve was the waivers for everyone, even if you are just going to sit at the tables and watch, you have to sign the waivers which is done on an ipad and takes forever to complete.
Other that that, the place is great!! Atmosphere is good.  Kid friendly place. Nothing intimidating here, everyone gives each other space and respects others. 
From looking at the photos from other reviewers, it looks like they change the climbing rock formations once in awhile, to keep it interesting and challenging. Great idea!!!

The pork and duck paté with pistachios is a prime example of the harmonious balance of these elements, all of which are fully enhanced by the typical accompaniments of delicately brined cornichons and a smear of whole grain mustard.  The lightly toasted baguette provides a compact vehicle for one to experience what many would consider to be ""the perfect bite,"", however, the most pleasurable method of consumption proved to be with just a lowly fork.  The intricacies of the paté were fully expressed and an instantaneous pork euphoria commenced.
 
If the paté is not enough to satiate the appetite of a Sus aficionado, a recommendation for the braised pork shoulder in applejack is well deserved.  There are few combinations better than the sweetness of apple and the richness of pork, heightened by the fattiness this particular cut lends.  The slow braising allows the pork fat and collagens to act like a veritable meat candle, something your local home decorating stores should most definitely be investing in, providing succulent and tender meat and a gentle lingering mouthfeel.  The bed of polenta not only provides a pedestal for the main event, but a sponge that allows each drop of the accompanying braise reduction to be devoured.  The sautéed endive draped over the polenta like a piece of lingerie thrown over the side of the bed... initially it may not seem like anything special, but the slight bitterness cuts through the richness and helps maintain a perfect balance of what would otherwise become DEFCON 1 in the war on flavor.

A simple raclette with crusty baguette was a warm, gooey accompaniment to the meal.

Service was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, two very important elements in a place that has a seasonal and ever changing menu.",0,70P8kYcQES7EhV7Uqg_CIA

5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,8,2012-05-13,8,OAnHlp1K-9SkuQBE6f1s2Q,5,"Why hello beautiful.  How's it feel to take the ""favorite hotel"" title away from Aria?

Just from passing through Cosmo on my previous trips to Vegas, I've been pretty fond of the place.  Their location is fantastic (between the Bellagio and Aria/City Center, and across the street from PH and Paris), and the design and décor are pretty awesome (particularly the ""changing art"" in the elevators and lobby).  And while they aren't as large as other hotels on the strip, they have a ton to offer - the latest hot spot in Vegas (Marquee), restaurants galore (Holsteins!), a three level bar (The Chandelier), late night eats (Secret Pizza), shops (Kid Robot!) and my favorite buffet (Wicked Spoon!).  Despite all that though, it was my stay at Cosmo that impressed me the most.

While my friends and I have always wanted to try out the Cosmopolitan, their room rates have always pushed us towards cheaper alternatives.  As fate would have it though, a couple of my friends were able to find a great deal online for the weekend we were going - only $140 a night!  However, with suites going for just $20 more a night, I decided to upgrade myself.  Yes, you read that right - a suite just for myself...and it was the BEST.  DECISION.  EVER.  The suite was ridiculously nice - king size bed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=q5V5Gp8j2gKI67Tsn1CU5w), separate ""living room"" area (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3LtdG6s3yKaRruPsy1sqbA), kitchenette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=eUnijzgD54vUz7BhZANnJw), walkout balcony (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3n1FgIqv2yDFrDpYLob72w), two flat screen TV's, separate tub and shower (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=svlV_W_Z81nArE3oubllCg), dual sinks(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=5lxiFXsbbJxtzeZ63l9a0w)...way more than I actually need from a hotel room.  And it was awesome! 

Even though my stay was great, their service made it that much better - every worker I talked to (front desk, maids, dealers, pit bosses, Beck and Call guys, bell hops) was super nice and friendly.  Cosmo offers so much to love and so little to dislike, I could only come up with one bad thing about them - now that I've spoiled myself with one of their suites, I don't know how I'm going to be able to go back to a regular room.

Crud.

**Quick notes:
- On Friday nights, guys staying at Cosmo can get into Marquee free until 11:00pm, provided they have a 1:1 ratio.
- There are two towers - East is closer to the main part of the casino while West is closer to the front desk/Wicked Spoon.  My friend had the same suite as I did in the East Tower, but his room seemed smaller.  Not sure if that's the case for every room or not though.",9,JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA

The burgers are freshly ground short rib steak burgers. At six ounces each, they are also a pretty good size at the starting seven dollar price point. They proclaim that their brioche buns are homemade and they definitely taste fresh. The burgers are served medium-well by default but mine was slightly undercooked. The beef was delicious though. I got the classic which is your basic lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle (slices, not chips), and the Blacow Sauce, which was basically Thousand Island dressing. You can also get the Wagu beef for a couple dollars more.

The fries were fresh cut, like the kind you would get at a bar or the beach and that taste delicious with malt vinegar. They were a huge portion and definitely not frozen.

It seems like a franchise, but I am unsure if it is. Order at the counter and they will bring your food to you. It's a nice space. They had signs up for beer but didn't seem to be serving it yet.

I can't believe I actually entertained them but as soon as they finished with their sales pitch without even asking if I was interested the guy pulls out an application and begins asking for my information to get credit started.  I immediately told him I was not ready to get into another credit card payment and I am not interested.  He continued trying to make me feel guilty about my family's health and we shouldn't put a price on it....blah, blah, blah.  The seller then says let me see a correspondence or ID to see if you qualify, this is when he completely insulted my intelligence.  He looks at the mail and pretends to plug something into his phone and then says, ""yes you qualify for financing and you only pay $40 a month""  I asked how in the world would you know that, he proceeds to point to some numbers above my name on this letter ...COME ON ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! He knew how I was not the least bit interested but continued to pressure me  to the point that I felt this was too overwhelming for me and maybe they can leave me alone if I sign this sh*t. My husband was not around to help me out of this so I said yes and asked if I'm not satisfied with product can I return and they said yes, don't worry, and trust us. I told them I need to speak with my husband first then I will call him the next day to confirm.
I was so uneasy with this whole transaction that I could not sleep, had knots in my stomach and just didn't feel RIGHT.  Sure enough the next day I researched this company and saw so many negative reviews, and at this point I didn't care how great the products worked (and by the way amazon sells for a fraction of the cost). Someone online stated that the only way she got a refund was by cancelling your transactions by the first days of the sale.
I called the seller and of course his phone does not receive incoming calls.  So emailed him stating I will be cancelling my order today!  He immediately calls me and I tell him I want to cancel and furthermore I told him not submit my paperwork until I called him to confirm after I discuss with my husband , he responds, "" no don't worry we already processed your paperwork. He again reassured me that if I need a return it will be given to me, trust him and quickly rushes off the phone...HA!  
At this point I am being stringed along and feeling frustrated and taken advantage of.  I immediately called the company directly and questioned their return policy.  The rep stated that they there are NO RETURNS ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  You are only able to cancel within the first 3 day of transactions.  After those 3 days pass you are bind by contract to make payments even if you are not satisfied with product.
Follow these directions for returns:  please do so by before the first 3 business days of signing the transactions
1. Call the company (877) 494-2289, cancel and ask for a cancellation number
2. Fill the back of the sales transaction and print the cancellation # on the front and back of form
3. Fax to (708) 562-0320
4.  Call to verify they received fax
The customer service people are courteous and are not pushy at all!  When I called to verify they received my fax they said yes and it was sent to the distributor.  I will check in 5 days.
PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES THE TROUBLE and to don't fall for this! They are slick and also try to tell if you cancel the salesperson gets a points on license and could lose their license. Well maybe they need to stop being pushy and if someone says not interested keep it moving and leave them alone.  SORRY BUT NOT SORRY to the sales person.

I go to Jtown for groceries and haircuts anyway, and was happy to stumple about this in the Yelpverse without having to go downtown.  One of the stuggles I have, is that with a toddler, izakayas and ramen houses are typically not very 2 year old friendly.  I would have given this place three stars, as well, they are great but I mean at a level that I would expect...but they were super kid friendly.  They have highchairs, bowls, and utensils for kids and were super cool with us having a child with us.  Some places give you daggers with their eyes, this place the staff seem to love having kids and yes at least while I was there all the kids including mine was well behaved.  

I ordred the Tonkotsu ramen, and it was what I would expect.  The rich milky broth, with noodles with the right bite.  Meet was tender and flavorful.

We waited about 45 minutes for a table in that super cramped little area. That was a mission and a half on its own..plus the cost of being hungover and it was snowing outside (As usual) so I wasn't the happiest per say.


Anyways, we sat down to a cute booth (super props to them fro having a booth that I actually fit into..super props for that)

1. The Westtern Sandwich - This was.. okay. The eggs were overcooked for my taste, and there wasn't a top of toppings. The bread could've used some butter, but yea. The boom frites were amazing though. Super super super good.

3. The Power Breakfast - Standard fare

4. My friend's Omelette.- didn't get to try this.

This is a rare spot in the city and if you like fine chocolate, definitely try it. I love that they add savory flavors to the chocolate (olive, cedar and on and on)

The woman who helped me select my chocolates was a pleasure. She was really nice and made some suggestions, and patiently waited for me to decide.

I recently was at Polished getting a mani after work, and decided that instead of cooking dinner when I got home, I would just pick up some take-out instead.  

I went over to Basil and placed an order to go and had a glass of wine at the bar while I waited. I forgot the name of the wine, but it was an Australian Sauvignon Blanc that was very quaffable.  It was either $8 or $9 for a glass, which is a typical price-point for that quality of wine in this area. The pour was somewhat generous, so that is a plus. 

When it came time to order, I did not see Penang Curry, which is one of my favorite dishes at the Thai House.  I mentioned it to the bartender since I was placing my takeout order at the bar.  She commented that Penang Curry is ""not really Thai, it is more Indian"". Huh...really?  Not sure about that but I just let it drop, and ordered Red Curry with chicken instead. 

My order was ready pretty quickly, so as soon as I finished my glass of wine, I went home to dig into dinner. Truthfully, I was a bit disappointed in it. They were not overly generous with the chicken and the red curry was ok, but a bit on the bland side. (I had ordered it as medium spicy, not mild.)  It contained bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil... but overall was not really that flavorful and did not satisfy my Thai craving. 

I do think they are priced a little higher than some of the local competition - I think my total for 1 glass of wine and 1 entrée was between $26-28.  I don't mind paying a little more if their food blew the others out of the water... but based on this visit, that is just not the case. 

Unless they give me  a really compelling reason to go back, next time I have a craving for Thai, I will more likely go back to Bahn Thai instead.",2,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA

We ordered The Big Meat and the Chicken & Rib Duo for three of us to share. For sides we had Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans. The close slaw is creamy but not sweet. It has a good crunch to it which stands up nicely to the meltiness (I just made that word up) of the meats. A lot of people are serving Mac n cheese but most of it lacks flavor. Theirs has a bit of crunchy topping and is flavorful. It's a great pick for a side. My favorite side, however, is the baked beans. They are smoked. I don't know if many places that have smoky baked beans. They compliment the BBQ meats. 
The chicken literally fell off the bone. I picked up a chicken leg and I pulled the skin off to try it. BOOM! The meat fell off. The ribs had a great bark on them. The bones slid right out. The Brisket was some of the most tender brisket I've had. It was cut into cubes. It was easier to eat it that way. The pork was shredded and very moist. They were running Brisket Chili for $5.

That was as recently as about 2 years ago and now I can't get enough.  I don't think it's the restaurant that changed,  it was my appreciation for homestyle food. 

Grab a tray and some silverware and slide down the line making your selections like you did in school, only with far more and better choices.  
First are salads...garden, macaroni,  weird pea salad...all kinds of salad.
 Next in line are desserts.  Yeah it's a little weird layout.  There are several different pies including sugar free,  cakes, banana pudding, and cobblers. If they have strawberry cobbler you should get that.
 Next up are the meats. Everything rotates but you can usually expect a meatloaf, some sort of fried chicken, both fried and baked fish, and maybe some spaghetti or chicken n dumplings.  
My favorite - the side dishes. Mac and cheese, creamed corn,  carrots,  pintos, green beans, fried okra, dressing,  mashed potatoes and gravy, cabbage and probably twice that. 
Finally we have breads. I always say I'm not going to get bread because I already got so much but it calls my name. They have rolls the size of my head that glisten with butter, really good mexican cornbread,  and other assorted breads that I never choose because those I mentioned are so good. 

Highlights: strawberry cobbler, mac and cheese,  dressing, okra, and chicken with white gravy. Omg last time I had it, it was better than my momma's fried chicken.",3,qWFc8k7e61RmCJL2xQmWRA

You point to the one you like (mixed greens with salmon or shredded chicken or other meat toppings or fruit & nut) and pick the dressing you want. If you don't like the ones they premade, you can order from their menu. They also have panini and other non salad items, which I haven't tried. 
You don't know the price of the premade salads until you get to the cash. Salads range $9-11 ish. You can help yourself to croutons, sunflower seeds and one more thing (I forgot) for your salad at the cash register. I have only tried their premade salads. They are huge and you actually feel full for the rest of the day.
The people are curt; don't expect smiley greetings. Also, their nuts in one of the salads tasted and smelled really, really old. Other than that, a reasonably priced healthy option in that world.",0,uDPgnEv6jZa4CSv6NX49TQ

My nails look absolutely terrible . I should have just walked out when I saw the tech's hands, but for some reason I still sat down . First things first, she didn't remove my gel properly ... she had it soak for like 20 mins and it still didn't even budge . There was still spots of polish on it when she started, but I was getting virtually the same color so I let it slide . She didn't soak my hands to do a manicure and she didn't clean my nails properly before adding the gel . My manicure looks terrible and she didn't clean up the edges nails at all . The paint is uneven, has bubbles in it & is all over the place . I asked her to fix it multiple times and she said she would but never did . On my feet, she didn't give any type of massage at all . She just poured oil all over my legs and then wiped it off with a dry towel . The towel left lint on my toes, which she didn't clean with alcohol before she tried to put the gel on. The clear base layer was uneven, had bumps in it,  and there was towel lint on 2 of my toes (which I pulled out myself because she said she couldn't see it). I brought the rough base to her attention before I dried it and she ignored me multiple times even after I pulled my foot away to stop her and show her what I was talking about before I put my foot in the dryer . The colored polish looked extremely streaky and started to clump and bubble as she put the first layer on, because she didn't clean my nails with alcohol first before applying the gel, and she just kept trying to paint over it . She just kept saying ""it will even with next coat"" and I explained to her that it was the base coat and she ignored me . I was there for over 2 hours and I left completely livid . My tech was the only person who was there when I left so I couldn't even ask to have it fixed or re-done by someone else. To top it all off, I saw that she was taking the cotton balls out of the foil that she had used on my toes and SAVING THE FOIL !! That was completely disgusting and unsanitary and I was repulsed .

You see, my father died as a result of the blunt force trauma he received at Sante, the very night he was brought there and I told them he was a fall risk and needed to be in direct sight and restrained if necessary.

He was medical helicopter'd to St. Joseph's in Phoenix. He never stood a chance. All of this could have been prevented and Sante of Mesa failed to do this.

My view is, if you are capable of speaking up for yourself and taking care of yourself such as needing rehab for a surgery, then this place may be great for you.

They looked like termites after reviewing similar pictures on the internet.  We were nervous and called Magic Wand to order an inspection.  Paul told us the NV Dept. of Agriculture offers a free identification service if we would bring them in.  They would identify the bugs within a couple of weeks and we would know if we had a problem.  Then he spent a couple of minutes explaining the different types of termites and how they function so we had a quick idea of some of the things to be aware of.  An incredibly knowledgeable individual with a true dedication for his work.  What a great person to educate us when he could have just sold us on an inspection!,1,5U0PBtBL5fXNVYWmkMl5xg

Our waiter,  Valentino was very personable and professional. The menu starts with either a tasting menu which consisted of antipasto, pasta, entree and desert or an ala carts menu which for one who has a hard time making decisions seemed overwhelming. With the help of Valentino- we went for the tasting. 

The antipasto was tasty olives, spicy cheese stuffed figs and a small meatball. The crackle bread/ bread with pesto, salt, butter and hot pepper was to die for. My angel hair pasta with shrimp small plate was delicious. My husband loved his penne bolognese. 

By the time we got to the entree, I for one was full. My salmon was cooked to my liking but not particularly special and spoiler alert....My husband's lamb entree was quite dry. When we told Valentino he was truly saddened and offered to get a new one. We explained there was no need but felt it important that the chef know. He promised to share our critic. 

Not being dessert lovers we skipped the beautiful dessert cart and instead we hade a cappuccino which was creamy and delicious and  delivered a large bowl each of natures perfect sugar... berries which were fresh and very satisfying. 

Without prompting  the manager came over to our table to express his deep apology for the disappointing lamb and gave a generously large discount off the cost of one dinner. That was never asked for but greatly appreciated. 

Oh and we made sure not to miss the photo both on the way out. 

All in all I think it was a great experience and we would do it again.",3,OwWOl11P1Dg6qP_vEiXHQw

We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.  I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member). When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly. How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size. The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual. They seated us promptly (no waiting). There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch. He was so nice! Now comes the food part. It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order. Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables. The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing. Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant. I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table. So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.  And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff. I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs. All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'. But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning. And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size). Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe. (One member of the party had to order special for their diet). Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed. After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill. My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed. The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress).

I would say that the crust was a bit overlooked for my taste. It was quite crisp but not burnt. I felt like the sauce was non existent. I understand that garlic sauce is a light sauce, but I have had some great garlic sauces. Plus having only cheese, I should be able to taste garlic. Overall, bland. Now the Cleveland Burger - think a Roman Burger. I would venture they cook the burger in the pizza oven. The edges of the burgers are extremely crispy, yes, crispy. Even with the Italian dressing, cheese, tomato & lettuce, it still crunched when I bit into it. I would be a good sandwich if the burger was properly cooked. Sorry, I don't like crunchy burgers.

My insurance company sent me a list of 'preferred' shops and they all had less than stellar reviews. Seeing the wonderful feedback on line about Lovetts, I decided to give them a shop. 

From my 1st phone call, they were a pleasure to deal with. They answered any and all questions, contacted my insurance company when the initial estimate did not fully cover the damages, arranged for additional inspection, & handled the financials directly with my insurance. They called to keep me updated when my car needed additional days in the shop. They even fully explained to me how Hertz works to pick up/drop off rentals at their shop. 

When my car was ready, they informed me that my battery had died while in the shop. They jump started it every day to move it when they worked on it. I wasn't surprised, as it had never been replaced in the 5 years I owned the car & I'd seen some telltale signs that it might be failing. They very kindly offered to get the battery & install it by the time I came to get my car that afternoon, saying that they didn't want me to drive down the road, only to have it die. They even provided me with the invoice, showing what they paid and giving me proof of purchase for warranty replacement if needed. I'll just say that sourcing my particular battery was quite the chore, but they came through and installed it. 

When I got there, one of their wonderful guys had my trunk popped open and was putting a covering back on the inside. He noticed that my license plate light was out, so he took it uppon himself to pop a new one in. So awesome! 

My car was washed & sparkly clean. The repair work was stellar. I really felt taken care of & like they cared about doing great job. I will absolutely use them again & would send any of my friends and family to them.

Faster than a cab? Check. Shows up in minutes, as opposed to 45 mins - 2 hrs (and maybe not at all)

Cleaner than a cab? Check. These are people's personal vehicles, so they're absent of puke (and Zeus knows what else) stains/smells.

Safer than a cab? Check. Lyft's rating system makes for accountability. Cabs lack this and act like creeps, without any consequence. Plus you see a picture of your driver long before he/she shows up, so you know you're not going to get a sea pirate or homeless looking guy as your driver.

Friendlier than a cab? Check. They offer you a bottle of water, a charger for your phone, a seat up front, your choice of music, choice of navigation, and sometimes gum or snacks. When's the last time a cab offered these things?

More convenient than a cab? Check. You simply tap a button and a driver shows up minutes later. No calling dispatch and/or wondering where the hell your driver is (you see him moving toward you on the app). Plus you pay over the phone whenever is convenient, so no worrying about if the drivers only accepts cash or cards etc. etc.

Bing soo, coffee, AND shakes? I'm in heaven and it's raining Korean style snow! We were looking for a place to have a cool refreshing dessert and someone didn't want bubble tea (Hint, it's not me ;p) so Ice Lab was a good compromise. The shop is a couple doors down from Asian Cafe Express and is hard to miss since it has a blindingly bright white interior inside with a brightly lit sign outside. 

All the selections sounded so delectable but I was set on having something with snow and some coffee. I saw that they offered affogato so naturally I had to order it :). I'm always a sucker for green tea dessert so I went with the green tea snow.

It was a bit mesmerizing watching the gentleman at the counter making the snow. He rotates it around and then adds the green tea sauce in layers, along with some cereal and shaved almonds to make sure there is a bit of delicious lightly crunchy hidden dessert treasure in each bite you take into your colorful sweet avalanche. I was a bit skeptical at the use of Frosted Flakes around the sides and inside the snow but it worked out as a nice textural component while also adding a little punch of sweetness to the creamy snow and green tea flavor. The almonds were a great mix in as well, providing a bit of nutty flavor and light delicate crunch. 

The snow itself was very light and fluffy. We had no problem finishing that dessert!

I also enjoyed the affogato. The espresso was strong and smooth, and the gelato was rich, thick and creamy, a perfect counterpoint to the espresso. 

The gentleman at the counter was friendly and delivered our shake and affogato right to our table.

If I'm in the area and craving a delicious snow or affogato you bet I will head over to Ice Lab!",28,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

#1) The health score / restaurant grade system must be extremely generous, because I can't imagine most of the 'A' rated places in Vegas passing with anything higher than a 'B' in LA -- and probably more likely, a 'C' grade. Unfortunately, I don't think Ronald's is exempt from this predicament.

#2) Las Vegans are afraid of real Vegans. I base this not only on the fact that there's NOTHING for us to eat in the whole city (save Ronald's Donuts and Rainbow's End), but also on the fact that Ronald's doesn't advertise the fact that most of their donuts are in fact vegan. I think they're genuinely afraid if they advertised their donuts as ""vegan,"" they'd lose business because people on the SAD would be too doggone afraid to try them! So they don't tell anyone that their donuts are vegan unless you ask directly. And when you DO ask directly, the sweet lady behind the counter (bless her heart) actually seems to look both ways to make sure that other customers won't overhear her. Sad but true... If only people would smarten up and check their insecurities at the door.

Regardless, I was thrilled to have some yummy animal-friendly donuts during my stay. It's a little beacon of light for tourists and locals who want something tasty and vegan. Many thanks to the kind folks at Ronald's.",0,lOFBy0gVGOV0VapjoNZdlQ

craving something out of the norm like Chili's or Apple Bee's. Remembering an authentic
Tuscan restaurant my best friend is always raving about called Brio, I decided to finally give
in and try it out. When I first arrived I discovered the restaurant was located right in the middle 
of an outside mall area where everything was condensed, giving it that downtown feel, which
I liked. Walking through the door I felt immediately out of place. The décor and just the plain
feel of the restaurant gave a high class first impression. Instantly I was greeted by the hostess
and asked if I wanted an indoor or patio table. Since it was a perfect day outside I opted for the
outdoor table. Looking at the menu I could see that this was going to be a more expensive trip 
than eating at a Chili's. Items on the menu were ranging from $17-$25, but as I always say the 
more expensive the item the better it probably is. After about five minutes of looking at the menu
I was greeted by my waiter bearing gifts of hot delicious bread and a plate of butter. Ordering a
lasagna with bolognese sauce and a diet coke, I eagerly dug into the piping hot bread that was in 
the middle of the table. Within a few minutes the waiter had brought out my salad that came with 
my meal and made sure everything was copasetic. Grabbing my fork and taking the first bite I
realized this wasn't a salad one could get anywhere. The taste was a blend perfection mixed with 
creamy ranch, fresh olives, and croutons. The lettuce was cold and crisp, croutons were just the 
right level of crispness, olives seemed fresh and didn't have that nasty after taste like when I get
them from Subway, and the ranch whether it was from a bottle or in a package tasted like it was
freshly made that day. The main course arrived just as I finished my last bite of salad, like my
waiter was diligently watching until I had my fill of the salad. As he laid the steaming hot plate
of lasagna on the table he asked me if I would like some fresh parmesan cheese on the top. ""Of
course good sir"", I replied. The plate that lay before me was a lot bigger than I anticipated, about 
12 inch plate with a bigger than expected rectangle shaped piece of lasagna smack dab in the 
middle, covered with marinara sauce around the sides of the lasagna and bolognese sauce on the 
middle. The sight and the aromas coming from this glorious plate of lasagna was making my
mouth water. Taking my first bite I relished in the extraordinary taste of sausage, fresh ricotta
cheese, marinara sauce and a variety of spices which blended perfectly together to make one
fantastic dish. From the moment I walked into Brio Tuscan Grille, to the moment I paid my tab
and left, the experience as well as the food was well above par. I shall be returning many, many 
times in the future.",0,6iElR23tamv4iDLqVpxgOg

Who would have thought at the age of 12 you would be  concerned  with style and clothing. I now realize that clothes mean everything when you're a teenage, boy or girl. 

Fortunately, today there are a lot of options for teens. There are so many popular stores that cater to a younger demographic making it easy to find clothes.

Over the weekend, I took my nephew clothes shopping.  I mentioned about a dozen different stores, all of which  he responded with a head nod.  My nephew asked if we could go to Tilly's.  I have never heard of Tilly's, but thought it was worth a try. 

 I was pleasantly surprised as we walked into.  Tilly's offers men's clothing, women's clothing, kids' clothing, backpacks, shoes and accessories from all the popular brands.

The staff at Tillys  is helpful, accommodating, and they take their time helping you find exactly what you are looking for.  The prices are reasonable and a selection is large. 

If your looking for the ""in"" clothes, give Tillys a try.",2,MMf0LhEk5tGa1LvN7zcDnA

We arrived on Sunday morning and the weather was dismal, raining and a little windy.  We couldn't really reschedule our golf because we were leaving town the next day - so we toughed through the first 9 holes.   The course was reasonably priced and well-kept.

Weird thing: there was no plastic guard on the front of the golf cart, so with the rain, driving a golf cart was just not that much fun this time unfortunately.

We didn't get to the back 9 as the wind and rain picked up significantly, and it just stopped being enjoyable.  

We ended up at the clubhouse to grab lunch and figure out our refund / raincheck situation.  This was not great to be honest  (and why it  lost an additional star) .    The service at the clubhouse was great - food was ok, but the bartender was fun and talkative.

Back to the pro-shop: We were offered a $60 merchandise credit at their proshop, unfortunately, they had nothing which would fit me save the hats (ie. nothing sized medium).    If we didn't want a merchandise credit, we could get 6 free drink tickets which does not equal $60...we ended up getting our $30 meal paid for, and basically had to forget about $30.

First off, I booked my reservation months in advance for March Madness at the Monte Carlo after having a great experience here previously. I generally trust the Mlife resorts (being part of the Mlife program) with the MGM and Aria being my favorite.

During booking of this hotel, there was absolutely ZERO mention at any stage that it was undergoing a complete overhaul and that construction was running rampant.

After getting in 12 hours before my reservation, I spent the night on slots and the tables. Finally when I was allowed to check in at 6am, I ran up to my room to lie down to rest. Within an hour, sawing, drilling, grinding noises right next to my window waking me up. I stormed down to the desk only to be greeted by a line for guest services extending 30 plus people. I waited 45 minuets to speak with someone only to be told ""we have been under construction for about a year, no one told you?"" 

Very upset, running on no sleep, I exchanged some harsh words and was moved up to a higher floor.

Things were beginning to look up. The room was newly renovated, pretty nice with a good view.

Then I went to take a shower... abysmally shower pressure. I could get cleaner with a bucket and a rag.

Continuing on, I decided to book dinner at a restaurant at the Aria called Lemongrass (You can read about that experience in another of my reviews.) I called down to the concierge to book a reservation to which I was told they were completely booked. Not to be deterred, I called the restaurant directly to which I was told... and I quote ""Yeah, 7:30pm works great for tonight... we are wide open."" 

I don't understand why a concierge would lie to someone trying to book a reservation at a Mlife property, but that definitely rubbed me the wrong way.

The sports book, especially for a huge weekend like March Madness was a nightmare. Usually only 1 attendants was working, lines queued to 50+ people. Just poorly ran and managed.

A star saver was the Mlife attendants. I was rewarded for my consistent spending and gambling at Mlife hotels upon check out.

The construction just ruins the experience for me. The resort is very hard to access with the construction and the scaffolding's everywhere are just an eyesore.

Yes I previously had a fantastic experience but I believe this update was necessary.

I don't believe I will stay at this hotel again, probably returning to my favorite MGM or giving Aria a chance.",1,54PyGYYuKLCVLnmI2zDsvQ

Little dance floor, no space to sit (only if you reserved those VIP tables-which practically takes up all the room in the club, otherwise good luck standing in heels for 5 hours), this place was over packed, way over the occupancy limit. 

Watch out for those annoying couple of people or groups, who 'pretend' to pass through to the other side, but then decided to stop and stay in front of you, after you been there for quite some time.

I expected it to be packed because of Calvin Harris, but not in a horrible way that it was. People TSwift ain't gonna be there, he's just DJing.

If your already on that dance floor, good luck getting out of it if you need to leave( it will literally take you 15 minutes) there is no direct passage/walk way, all blocked! Security don't give a shit, people get shoved and pushed. 

Calvin Harris didn't even perform until 1:30am!! seriously? disappointment. I know its Las Vegas and all, a night to stay out late and get wild, but this club wasn't worth it.

Checkin was an absolute nightmare; it took over an hour for a line that wasn't really that long. Upon arrival, I discovered that I had accidentally booked a smoking room through Orbitz (even though I specified that I wanted a non-smoking room, I somehow chose an ""upgraded"" room in a tower that ONLY has smoking rooms...wtf). The girl who checked me in said that she could get me a non-smoking room in another tower, but that it would cost extra. I agreed only because I didn't want to spend a week in a room that reeked of cigarettes.

Turns out, my new room came equipped with pillowtop mattresses and a mini fridge. I later wondered if I could have transferred to a room in another tower that didn't have all these bells and whistles and not have had to pay extra. Oh well...

The pool is a LOT smaller than the other Vegas hotels I have been to. The Riv is also not very convenient to other places on the strip. It IS, however, located very close to a Walgreen's where you can stock up on goodies for your mini fridge. The layout of the hotel is awful and it's hard to find anything -- but I suspect most Vegas hotels are arranged like this so that you find yourself getting lost in the massive casino.

At one point, the girl who I was sharing the hotel room with called down to the front desk to ask about using the safe that came in our room. She was on hold for 20 minutes and was transferred twice just to ask this simple question.

The accommodations are fine, but they will upcharge you for everything and the customer service blows. I would recommend finding lodging elsewhere on the strip.",4,zMEdR4h7FHNExwQLKvPP8g

There is one girl who works morning with curly hair, and if I always got her, I'd continue to go here, but every other employee I've encountered there needs to get out of customer service and quick.

On my first visit, I intended to order an iced caramel macchiato. The girl with the curly hair gave me a hot one. I couldn't remember for sure that I'd said iced, so I accepted it without comment. She thanked me, told me to have a nice day, smiled, handed me my drink and I was on my way.

On my second visit, I got the curly haired girl again. Very similar to my first visit except my drink was made like I wanted. I was happy.

On my third visit, I was in a hurry so I decided to skip the drive thru and go inside. I was actually in such a hurry that I just ordered iced coffee. The couple that had been in front of me got their drinks, so I thought I'd be on my way soon. The male half of the couple got the barista's attention to let him know the drink was made wrong. By this time, I realized I'd made a mistake by stopping because I was going to be late. So I got a female barista's attention (not the curly haired girl..she has straight, blondish gold hair) and told her that I had to go and I just didn't want them to worry about making my drink. I promise you I was in no way rude. It wasn't their fault that I was in a hurry. I was just planning on forfeiting the $3 I'd paid. The older guy behind her asked me if I'd had the iced coffee. He sounded aggravated. I said yes, so the girl made it quickly and gave it to me. She was also clearly annoyed. I thanked them thoroughly and told them that that was unexpected but appreciated. They didn't reply. 

My last visit was in the drive thru again. Again, they were very busy. I ordered an iced caramel macchiato again. The older guy was at the window this time. He handed me a hot caramel macchiato. Since I was certain I'd said iced, I nicely told him that I had ordered an iced one. He was obviously annoyed. He said ""oh"" and took it back. They then poured the hot one over ice and gave it back to me. No apology or ""thank you,"" Ora asking me if it was okay that they just poured the hot one over ice...just a ""here you go.""

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry.",1,zEAWtjwUPaCDsfuDlKkJaA

I've had several separate first dates here and the low-key atmosphere definitely helps get past the awkward first meeting. Most people are super surprised to see such a great bar on Yonge st these days, so it's a real stand out place if you're a fan of places like Bellwoods Brewery. As with Bellwoods, BarVolo brews a lot of their own beers and has an ever-changing menu which is both a good and bad thing. I've had a couple great beers here that I haven't been able to find again because they're always updating the beer list. Sometimes, it's hard to find a beer you like that suits your budget because there are so many options. I'm no beer aficionado but everything I've had there is pretty decent, and the servers are very knowledgeable and can recommend a good drink for you depending on your tastes.

The food is pretty good and it's fun to share the little plates with a date or friends. The charcuterie is decent and is always changing too, depending on what's fresh and available. It's kind of a small place with communal tables as well as small private tables. In the summer, there's more seating on the patio which can alleviate wait times, but in the winter, I've had to wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. But the wait time is usually quite quick -- quicker than you expect. There's also a more casual ""mingling"" area on the upper level by the bar where you can stand while you drink and wait for a table to become available, so it never seems like too long a wait, and the servers are quite good about notifying you in a timely manner.

Really love this place, love that it's away from the predictable areas like Parkdale or Queen west. Will definitely be back.",2,0qA24lu9d-NtCdSaNPc4lw

All you need is a dedicated mom-and pop style of management, a good understanding of traditional cooking and service with a smile. These things can be found at Buon Gusto.

I had the pleasure of dining here on valentines day with my girlfriend. It was, not surprisingly, quite packed. We were seated fairly soon by a friendly hostess. The place is tiny and quaint--- a decidedly humble little establishment with traditional Italian themed decorations lining the walls. It's nothing too fancy but a real fan could care less about the lack of extravagance--- its clean and well maintained. 

The bread was delicious-- better than I've had at Annie's Gourmet, and about as good as I had at Ventano's. The salads were excellent-- the best I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. They didn't skimp on the olives and the home made balsamic vinaigrette will be the best you've ever tasted. They offered us each a glass of wine with the special, which was penne pasta with a creamy sherry wine sauce and sliced chicken, topped with bruschetta. It was a unique taste to me-- I've never tasted such a wonderful mix of flavors in Italian cooking. We treated ourselves to canoli's for desert which were, of course, heavenly-- far and above the best I've ever had. 

The waiter was friendly throughout the experience and the rest of the staff was polite.

This time, we ordered 4lbs of mussels (garlic butter, good catch blend, Cajun), 2lb shrimp (garlic butter, good catch blend), 2lb clams (garlic butter, good catch blend), fried oysters, and some fries. 

Perhaps they were more busy this time, but they didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our food. I probably should've spoke up during the second round since my mother commented that it wasn't the same as last time. 

The sauces were tasty, but not spicy. Way too much sodium like how I remembered. They could take it down 2 notches and it'd be perfect. 

Shrimp was annoying to eat. Nothing special, but decent. 

Clams were surprisingly yummy. But definitely way more shell than meat. 

Mussels were the crowd fave - they were big, succulent mussels! Much bigger than I remember. Just thinking back to it makes me salivate a little.

The PIT Stop is a Boulder City institution.  I spent a summer working in Boulder City back in 1995 and we ate here regularly.  I don't make it back that frequently, but the nostalgia factor is tough to resist when I'm in the neighborhood.
I'm a big fan of the burgers...they probably aren't the best in the Las Vegas metro, but they are big and juicy and a great value.  They offer a couple different topping options including bacon, jalapenos, and green chiles.  The fries are fairly mediocre, but that mediocrity is eclipsed by the wonderful fry sauce and seasoning salt available on the table.  The milkshakes are also enjoyable...thick enough you need to eat with a spoon.
Although service can be a little hit or miss depending on how slammed the restaurant is (and believe me, it can get crazy in here), the waitresses are generally very friendly and are doing the best they can.

I stopped in around noon on a Friday for a polish change since I thought that would be an easy, less intense way to check it out than a manicure or pedicure.

Blue Sky is on the far end of a strip mall-ish facility, so the inside definitely felt very sterile to me (and not sterile like you want a nail salon to feel); the walls were white, the floor was tile, there was nothing on the walls, and there was no TV. It looked like they were planning to install one, so maybe they're still getting their decor down. However, it did seem very clean, and I saw a couple of rooms that were used for waxing. But I digress!

When I walked in, I told the two women behind the front desk that I needed a polish change. They asked hands or toes; I said hands, and that was the last time anyone spoke to me in English. They appeared to have a gel bar, which was pretty cool, but I'm a basic polish girl, so I I started looking for a color. Their selection was a seriously limited for natural/nude colors. They had OPI and another brand I didn't recognize, and the first color I picked looked like White Out on my nails. The technician nicely let me change and came up to the wall to help me pick. I wound up going with Bubble Bath - the only nude-ish color they had - which still isn't my favorite, but I wasn't sure how to leave halfway into a service.

The technician was nice enough, and I appreciated that she filed and buffed my nails and used cuticle oil since some other places literally just change your polish on a polish change.

When I left, there were two different women at the front desk/cash register. Neither of them spoke to me - they spoke to each other, trying to figure out their computer system and how much I owed them. There's a huge menu on the wall, so I pointed at it and said, ""It looks like I owe $8, right?"" The woman nodded and opened the cash register. I gave her a $20 and asked for $10 back, which she silently gave me, and I walked out.

Maybe they're still trying to get their feet under them and learn their systems, but customer service was pretty crummy and the ambiance leaves a little to be desired. There were a couple of other women getting pedicures/manicures, and one of them had wine (perk!) and the other was having all kinds of conversation with her technician, so maybe my experience was a one-off?",5,QmethzRyAvZXS9m1UNJpdw

I've booked many all inclusives before but never with AC. You always hear nightmares on Yelp when it comes to travel, but I feel it's important to mention when things are good. Especially when you always hear complaints about Air Canada.

The flight was on time, and was as comfortable as could be expected. Our baggage was ready immediately on both ends which was especially nice on the way home when all you want to do is get your stuff and sleep/nap.

More than anything, I was impressed by our Tour rep, Joel. He was a really genuine guy who met us when we got off the plane and gave us the lay of the land while the bus was taking us to Samana. Normally, they tour reps hop on the bus and  tell you that you have to come to some meeting the next day at 9 am to hear about all the important stuff they need to tell you (they want to sell you their tours and direct you to all the places they get kick backs from) No one needs this on vacation. Your first morning you want to eat and go to the beach. Then you never see the rep again, he's never at his desk or waits for 10 minutes a day and then takes off.

Joel was very different. There were people going to 2 different resorts on the bus and he gave us a really concise run down of what to expect at our respective hotels. He told us what his hours were at the resort and when we could come and see him to book tours or if we had any questions. We saw him in the lobby each day and in addition to helping us book our tour, he had his laptop out with the radar to let people know that the rain was clearing up. 

He speaks something like 6 or 7 languages and was very friendly and approachable. You got the feeling that he would take care of anything you needed. Vacation Suppliers need more reps like Joel. He was a bright light and a big help.

The only reason I took off a star was because of the lack of seat back entertainment. They give you I pads on rouge, but I think you have to pay for them. Also, no snackies or drinks. Sunwing always has sparkling wine and something to nibble on.

Way to go ACV. It's nice to give kudos to a company that takes so much flack, but I have to say that it was Joel who impressed us the most and I'll be writing a letter to Air Canada Vacations about him.

Well Done!!",1,_t3BJzyGaqr9mcDazYiYAQ

This place doesn't disappoint. When you arrive, expect to be in line for about 45min to a 1hr. If it is a hot day, it will feel like it is longer.  I am not sure how it is on weekdays, but on a Saturday we were in line for about this amount of time. 

The best things to order are the ribs, rib tips, brisket, and hot links. The meat is delicious and one of the Best in Vegas. If you are looking for some good home-cooked bbq, please visit this place, you will not be disappointed. It will be well worth the drive. 

The location of this place is closest to Gowan and Thom which is basically near Craig Rd and Decatur, that is in the northwest area of the valley. You will know when you are there when you see a bunch of cars parked on the ranch. They have tables outside where you can eat and chill too. 

However, if you order the chicken, order an additional meat or get the 2-3 meat combo because the chicken is on the small side for the amount of money you are paying. If you are trying to share a meal, or want to have leftovers, you will need to pair the chicken with another meat to do so. Moreover, if you get the brisket and rib tips combo, it will be enough for two or three days and it will also be more than enough to share with others. 

The side dishes are plentiful when you get them with the combo plate. If you want additional sides, they are very small and a bit over priced. Even though this place is pricey, the food quality does average this out. 

Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars because it is a good place to go for home cooked meals. Staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxed environment and family-oriented atmosphere.",2,sXCTBL0SfvucNjNnGejIEA

On a hot, hot night like tonight sitting on the patio, under the umbrella and sipping a cold cocktail off of Burger Bar's menu was divine! 
I tried the Cesar, which is maybe not the best, but a good effort. The Margarita is not served ""on the rocks"", nor do they have a blender. Hmmmm how else do you drink a margarita then? Tart and tequila-y, in a small cocktail glass, that's how. 
As for burgers, I never really like the 'bella burger unless I'm at home and only paying for the price of the 'shroom.  So, I opted for the veggie pattie, which was so darn tasty. It wasn't til the end that I think this might have some aspect of falafel to it... 
Anyway, with cheddar cheese and all the regular toppings, I am stuffed.  No, it's not McDo-cheap. It's also probably not worth it to upgrade to the Wagyu beef. But, a side of sweet potato fries to share (huge portions) is a great bargain at $4.

The rooms were very boutique and had full length mirrors!! Super girly and luxe. I'm pretty sad about the ""updates"" making it more masculine. I feel they should have allowed for choice. Instead they got rid of the boutique feel and although it's still nice it doesn't have that luxurious hotel feel. The bathroom used to have a window into the living room but they closed it off making the room less open. They took out the full length mirror closet doors and ready put it gorgeous dark wood but now I have no idea what my outfit looks like and makes selfies not as easy. The lighting is more dim and they took out the cute chandeliers in the rooms and replaced it with a ball light. 

They took out the awesome desk they had which allowed me to do my work while on trips in Vegas. So that kinda sucks. 

I like the new Alice in wonderland themed area by eggslut. It allows space to eat from there or the juice bar or milk bar. Plus the chandelier area there kept breaking because drunk guests would fall into it. 

The halls to the rooms are dimmer now and I have watched drunk people tripping on their way to their room.  

I wish they would:
1. Bring back full length mirrors in rooms
2. Have a button operated screen that opens the bath to the room 
3. Brighten up the halls to the rooms a little
4. Bring back CO Bigallow toiletries--it was so luxe",0,jNx2yH68BKhgxlsROOdtew

The portions are comically large, and the clientele tends to be the type of people who aren't particularly interested in portion control. A lot of older people seem to enjoy this place. That's not a bad thing, but it's a great place to bring your parents. 

I had previously eaten at other Hash House locations and had a decent experience. How this location has the same menu, there seems to be something up with the running of this place. 

First, there are a lot of people. It's a popular place, so there's a line. But to me that's not the issue. There were only two of us, so we only waited about 10 minutes. But ten we sat there another 40 minutes waiting for our food. The fact we both ordered salads makes the wait even more ridiculous.

When the food did come, that was the last we saw of our waitress for a while. Occasionally she would wonder by assuring us we're doing ok. Not once were we offered a refill during our meal. It was only after the plates were being cleared did the waitress ask if we wanted deserts or another drink. 

It's a shame the service sucks, because it's decent food and nice restaurant. I'm assuming right now there's so much business the management doesn't much care about the service level. I'm guessing they'll care a bit more in a year or so when the novelty of being new wears off.

Update: I'm going to update this to a 1 star review. The food is good, but there is sincerely something wrong with the service. Every time I go, I seem to run into a different problem. And DO NOT attempt take out. In the half a dozen times we've tried this, there has never been a time they have got it right. Every time requires me to go back there and get something they left out. And they genuinely don't concern themselves about this. The manager is about as apathetic as can be.

We had a table of six and he only took drink orders from a few of us.  We waited too long after getting our menus to order.  We inquired about getting 3 separate checks and instead of explaining their policy of separating checks 4 equal ways, with a long face he complained about what a time consuming difficulty that would be for him.  Then asked if we still wanted separate checks.  I ordered filet mignon medium rare and fingerling potatoes.   My steak arrived well done and  I sent the steak back and the replacement came back rare, I didn't send it back again.  Also, it was not a filet mignon, it was tough and it was more likely a tenderloin.  The potatoes were very dry as though they were warmed leftovers, by then I was just done with the restaurant and the lack of attention from our waiter that I didn't bother sending those back.

The one bright spot was the meatball appetizer.  We won't be back after this experience.",0,sX7yIvBaclL09-D6C1IMvA

It takes about a minute before your gun and vest recharge and you get to keep playing. They have teams . Red and blue. On your lazer gun is your ""team name"".

I saw their ads a few months ago and was very excited. My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. 

First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.

Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.

I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it.",16,M65ewlMzJX3pFMCIgoRdgw

Of course, I was a bit skeptical, but after coming out of the show, I was completely blown away by all of his mind-reading tricks, predictions, and seemingly supernatural abilities.  I've been a big fan of magic for a while, but after Frederic's masterful performance, I gained a deep sense of admiration and respect for him and mentalism.  Why?  Because there are so many variables involved, there's a greater risk of failure or the illusion not working.  Somehow (probably through years of practice and dedication), he hit one homerun after another.  
 
I don't want to say too much about the mental feats that he pulls off, but there was one in particular that involved two audience members that utterly floored me.  As soon as it happened, I whispered, ""No way!""  Some audience members gasped in surprise and disbelief, while others sat in stunned silence.  My fiancé said that trick gave her goosebumps, and I reiterated her sentiments.
 
After the show, Frederic was kind enough to take photos with audience members and perform a quick trick for each person.  A total class act that made the experience even more memorable!
 
Nearly a week later, my fiancé and I still talk about the show, bewildered and amused as ever.

I would have rated this hotel 5 stars for my multiple stays three years ago. It doesn't seem reasonable to slide in extra charges when the quality and service is declining.",0,gERwa9uWh256fZcaUs_02A

Community = 4: Mostly students and professionals. It does stay pretty quiet aside from the normal passing rudeness that comes with living among students (loud music from cars, screaming in the garage, etc). 

The hallways smell different almost every day! At least twice a week, it is burnt bacon. At least once a week, our neighbor leaves raw fish or chicken outside their door instead of walking it to the trash compactor. 

The company/concierge does try to create community events; we haven't attended any but they are usually well reviewed (i.e. Octoberfest with 13 beer selections, Sunday breakfasts, etc.). 

Grounds = 2: Inside the gates, everything is okay. For the most part, the trash is picked up. Now... outside the gate is a different story. Some of it is their property, some isn't; however, you'd think they would pick up the trash directly outside their front entrance even if it wasn't considered part of their property. 

Would you keep trash littered outside your front lawn and just say ""the city needs to handle that""? Probably not.

Crime/Safety = 1: Again, inside the gates, everything seems fine. However, we realized that all of the gates are high enough that even a large human could roll underneath. 

About a month ago, some homeless guy got in and was jumping from car to car outside the garage. Two months ago, a homeless guy set all of his stuff on fire about 3-6 feet outside of the gate. It caused a small explosion and there was a lot of smoke. Realistically, if he had any kind of lighter fluid he would have been able to get it into the complex quite easily. A month ago, a homeless guy got stuck in the drainage tunnel directly outside our window; it took hours for the police to get him out, and they had to cut down two gates to do it. 

Most of this stuff only affected us because it was late at night or really loud, etc. This isn't the kind of place where you can go for a walk/run right outside your neighborhood.

Staff = 3-4 (depending on the day): For the most part, the office staff is pretty nice. However, when they get busy they can get a little snippy. Sadly, they are usually busy, so for the most part I'd give them a 3. Also, they can be kind of all over the place. 

We still haven't been given any information about things we should have been told upon move-in. One person said another person would help us and vice versa. We've lived here for a couple of months now, so we just leave things alone at this point. 

Basically: if they are having a good day, you will get 4 star service or better. If they are having a bad day, you will get 3 star service or worse.

Amenities = 4: Everything in the photos online is legit. Great gym, really nice pool upstairs. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is the quality of some things offered has faded since the initial reno.

Location = 4-5: Pretty close to everything, but pretty much everything it is close to is dirty. While this place is only a mile from the strip, the mile is definitely clear. 

Basically: if you want to live in a location where even your grocery store, shopping centers and restaurants are nice, do not move in here. 

Views = 2-3: The east side of our apartment faces some mountains, but the south side of our apartment faces part of the UNLV campus. Which part are we across from? The giant solar panels. 

So the view outside our master bedroom and both balconies is two giant solar panels, a dirty sewer, and construction on Flamingo Road. 

Maintenance = 2-3: Staff is okay, there is one guy who is really nice... but for the most part, they will talk to you 1) any kind of way and 2) like you are an idiot. I know I don't appreciate being lied to, talked over or repeatedly given excuses. If you can find a way to fix something yourself, a YouTube video will probably be of more help. 

The cleaning staff is nice, but make sure you check your place out thoroughly upon move-in. Everything above 5.5/6ft in the apartment was untouched; the new resident should not be the one getting on the ladder to clean up, especially in the kitchen. The hallways don't get deep cleanings; sometimes we pass the same piece of trash for two weeks.

Apartment = 3-4: For the most part, we have a nice apartment. Still, the things we are paying for are cheap or fake imitations. The renovations completed by the current company have seen their fair share of destruction since. Things also seem to be permanently dirty, things like the toilets. Something is wrong with the electric system in the 2nd bathroom. In certain rooms, if you leave the lights on too long - get this - it smells like fish (I can't make that up smh). 

Basically: it looks nice when you are walking through quickly, but the longer you stay, the more you realize that this was installed incorrectly, or that is crooked, or this has a crack down the side, or this was painted accidentally (a very big problem in our unit). For the price you are paying, you expect more.",2,NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q

We had lunch first, following which I had a manicure and pedicure and my mom had a facial and manicure. Lunch was pretty good - nothing special but nothing to really complain about either. My mom really enjoyed her facial and said her esthetician was very skilled, knowledgeable and happy to answer a few questions that she had. I was a bit disappointed by the manicure and pedicure facilities. There are quite a few stations (almost too many for the room) which feel kind of squished together. The chairs aren't particularly comfy - there are no massage armchairs here. The room was also quite noisy and difficult to relax in. The quality of both my manicure and pedicure wasn't quite as good as I was expecting for a spa. Considering Elmwood charges significantly more than Nailsense, which I usually visit to get my nails done, I wasn't blown away. 

The customer service was quite good and everyone was friendly and helpful. The facilities are also nice and very clean. Overall, I would visit Elmwood spa again for other services, just not to get my nails done as I'm not sure its worth the steep price.",2,0aHS7t9paYxvKeAJ1SuHBQ
BsFAotQQE1yRVVJEDADaJw,2,2016-03-03 02:44:43,2,YYriFdTk5DCFOrKbxRApyw,5,"A friend of mine is a regular at Kanpai in Cabbagetown and cannot say enough good things about it, so it was time for a visit. Myself and 5 friends headed down to see what the fuss is all about. Everything about their menu is entertaining, take a look! They have a lot of options, many are gluten free, if that's your thing. They even have gluten free beer! (It's pretty good!) 

It's a small restaurant and you can only make reservations if you have at least 6 people. We grabbed seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen, a front seat to the action! Everyone was working hard as the orders in house and UberEATS piled up. It was a crazy night, but the wait for food wasn't too long. 

We ordered the Redneck. It came with 6 PBR, 12 sexy pieces of fried chicken, Taiwanese antipasto, choice of fried rice, naked bao with durty butter and tater slaw. It's a lot of food, but the perfect amount for 6 people. 

First up was the bao. Soft and fresh, this was my first time trying bao, but any bread product is a friend of mine. Next up was the Taiwanese antipasto. There were housemade pickles and other veggie delights. Good start!

My friends are spicy people, so our choice of rice was Red Rooster. It was a little spicier than I can handle, but everyone loved it. It had flavour and heat, a lot of spicy dishes don't get that combo, but this one was on point. The tater slaw was tasty. Not too much dressing to overpower the flavour of the crunchy veggies. 

Now for the main event, TFC! It was beautiful. Piled high and garnished to perfection, it was hot, fresh and ready to get on my plate. The batter was crisp and lightly seasoned. Not overly greasy, but not one of us picked the crunchy batter off. We were all fully impressed and full. 

The drinks! How to choose?! Their drink menu is equally as entertaining as their food menu. I chose the Silky Johnson. A sweet drink with vodka, muddled fruit, and flavours of peach and lemon. Amazing. 

For dessert we shared Ping Pong Beignets. Dough balls covered in sesame seeds fried and covered in sugar. I expected a Timbit like texture, but it was unique as they are made with yam and sweet potato. A must try! 

My second visit was equally delicious. I tried the OG Bao and Fingers of the Sea. I was also able to sample some You're Sizzlin Baby and Edamame Said Knock You Out. The OG Bao was ok, there was a lot more fat in it than I'd like, but the sauce was great and the cabbage gave it great texture. Fingers of the Sea wasn't what I expected. There did seem to be any batter, which was nice. The fish was a little sweet. The tartar sauce was perfect! The sizzling pork, arrived on a sizzling platter, was fantastic. Tender and peppery, it would be perfect on rice. The edamame wasn't special, but who doesn't love a little edamame?

The service was pretty good on both visits considering how busy it was on the weekend. All of our food and drink arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Can't complain since they were all nice and working hard. The décor is simple and functional with wooden furniture and walls. Great vibe!

Oh, I'll be back.",2,_zPT9ZmR5-nUfsprzIiRew

I walked in and was quickly greeted by Ed, sat down and showed him a picture of a lob as I wanted to even out my angled bob from December and needed to get rid of split ends. He gave me his opinion of the cut and told me it's an awkward length and will result in my ends flipping out for a while but will grow out nicely and settle down. I appreciated this as some stylists don't tell you anything and let you get a bad haircut!

I think...I'm pretty sure that I fell asleep sitting up during my hair cut, it was a pleasant experience and he spent a lot of time perfecting my lob making sure all the ends were even and perfectly styled. At the end he showed me my perfect lob in the mirror and said again it's an awkward length again assuring me it will grow out and look better, I told him I think the length is fine and I love it anyways! Ed is very polite and professional and I am already planning to come back to try a colour service:)

I really want to give this place 5 stars: the food is creative and fresh (and I suspect local as possible), the coffee is darn good & the cocktails & wine list looks solid, yet, fun.
Today I had the Octotillo Bowl for brunch. A bowl of farro with pistachio pesto, pickled peppers, bacon, arugula and 2 over easy eggs. What a tasty and unique combination, it was wonderful! As I said, the coffee was really good (I am a coffee snob, blame my parents).
The issue? Service & facilities. 
Our server was nice, personable, and quick to make recommendations. The problem? Timing or cadence; we had to request our coffee refills (the first time) from a server who was refilling waters because he disappeared. Later, when I asked for salt & pepper, I was halfway through my meal before he brought it. And finally, it took around 20-25 minutes for my dining companions credit cards to be returned after they sent them off with the bills. That made my friends nervous (understandably). It's a serious trust issue. Our server thought he'd already returned the cards, he said!
Then there was the facilities, left behind clothes hanger, and broken toilet seats?? I get it at 1 am on a Saturday night but Sunday morning? Not cool. I think perhaps a little more policing could be done.

I paid a 200$ start up fee and now 33$ per month. My sales rep. was sociable and professional and I was comfortable with the arranged payment plan. But what does that money get me?

The gym is less then a year old so the equipment and building are new and clean. With the appalling exception of the showers. There seems to always be at least two that are out-of-order, and the grime on them makes no sense what so ever for the time they have been in use.

Condos have created an arms race in the form of amenities they offer their residences. With increased competition fitness centers have begun a similar war to draw clients. Below are the amenities the Markham LA fitness offers and does not offer.

Offers

Basket Ball court- Not a full court size and always packed

Spin room - Lots of nice new bikes

Personal Training - I have only been bothered once about doing a fitness assessment 

Pool - much like the basket ball court, it is available but more so just to say they have one. Its barely bigger then a waiting pool

Yoga/ fitness class - Have not attended myself but I see them going on regularly 

juice bar - over priced

kids center - if I were a parent I would be appreciative 

Does not offer

Squash courts - squash is available at some LA fitness but only with a premium membership usually 5$ extra pre month

olympic lifting platform, running track, towels

If they fire whoever is the maintenance manager and get the cleanliness of the washrooms up to par I would raise this review to a respectable 3 star. LA has some work to do over all if they want to compete with Goodlife and the YMCA.",2,jNuaw_2e5DYKPx-MRdUEOg

In recent years, I've significantly changed my shopping habits, making a point to almost exclusively buy items that are made ethically, by people who are treated fairly. This generally means items that are made in USA, or are fair-trade, or otherwise have a transparent and clean supply chain. As you can imagine, it can be very difficult to find these items, especially in an actual brick-and-mortar store. This is why I appreciate Local Nomad so much, and why it's one of my go-to shops to browse for home goods, gifts, and accessories. The majority of the items I find here meet my shopping standards, and it's very refreshing to see a local shop embracing the same values that are important to me.

Everything slowly came out at intervals of 3-5 minutes in between each plate.  Our sushi didn't come out until 30 minutes after we placed an order & even then, it wasn't our full order.  We came on a holiday Monday around 1pm and the restaurant was quite full.  Any restaurant can be quick when it isn't busy but the true test is the speed and attentiveness when it is busy.

Waiters were rude, ambience was off, and it wasn't a place that you would stick around for dessert. 
I was soooo excited to dine at Mallorca so I was very upset and caught off gaurd when my experience was everything but what I expected.
Waiter came to our table very loud and obnoxious asking for our order... Didn't greet us... Didn't introduce himself.... NOTHING!!!! 
I ordered a half pitcher of Sangria and the Lobster Ravioli for myself. 
My Ravioli came out after about 40mins. and I thought that was a bit too long of a wait considering the place was nowhere near packed. It was very bland and it looked far from appealing. However, the taste was decent but I guarantee I could have found it in the frozen section of my grocery. 
They bring vegetables, house fries (potato chips), and cold bread also.
Veggies are definitely from a frozen and the chips have absolutely no flavor. 
The Sangria gets an A+ from me which is surprising because im not even a drinker.

Top top off everything off... At the end of our meal the man says ""I know this is your first time here. Just to inform you, most people tip 20%.)
Are you kidding me???? 
How rude!!!
And the fact that I dressed up to go to this place off of reviews was bizarre. The hostess had on jeans and a casual shirt.

Easy parking on the street and I think there's also parking off to the side. Staff are very friendly and nice. Everyone helps out. Nice place for a meet and not noisy at all. No decor and settings. 

Food was good. Soup du jour was delicious! The tuna bruschetta was good in taste and ok in presentation. It is basically everything as described on a toasted slice of bread. I didn't know how to eat it. Without cutting, things fell off the bread unless I held it horizontally to eat. I also have a small mouth. 

I made the error to cut it into fours. The bread is only hard around the edges. The center is very soft and everything fell onto the plate. :-( tip - fold it in half and open up the mouth.

I had expected bruschetta as small pieces of toasted bread slices with stuff on top. That would have made this dish perfect!

Everything tasted good, even the coffee. Not salty with balanced taste, I.e. Nothing over powering the other.

Ok, down to deciding.  I guess my main complaint was that nothing tasted particularly smoked.  The brisket was good, but if it was smoked as long as they claim, there should have been more smoke - there was just a narrow, light ring.

I had eaten at the old location a while ago and honestly remembered liking it a little more. The curry sauce itself has an enjoyable flavor to it and they offer a nice variety of options--several of which will do in a pinch, but none that entice me to come back to them. Fans of udon noodles can get Curry Udon...that's something you don't find everywhere, but not a big enough draw for me.

Like the 3 Stars say, they're ""A-OK."" There are better options in walking distance though which make me think I will not be coming back anytime soon.

Kaba Curry is open late--2am late...so if you are in the mood for Japanese Curry and it is after 11pm when all the other shops have closed down it would behoove you stop in for a late-night bite.

I had the Cajun shrimp appetizer it wasn't super spicy, it was good but I'd definitely try something else next time just because I think their menu won't have anything bad. The brisket sandwich was delicious, it's only offered on Thursday's if they have leftover brisket so I figured I had to try it while in town. I had it with cole slaw and the amazing  fried corn on the Cobb, and the black Betty for dessert- a great concept but not well executed.

We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22).

The mains were merely disappointing, I like the curry creamy, unfortunately the green curry with galanga and eggplant was not exactly what I have imagined, may be I did not like very much the fried tofu in the vegetarian choice.

Rex's new place (on Rainbow & Flamingo) is fantastically clean, warm and relaxing. Rex's wife Eileen is the perfect tag team partner if you are going in as a couple and need 2 masseuses. Where most casino and resort spas charge a premium for a 'couples massage' option, it is the norm at Best Foot Spa. I love taking out-of-town concert clients to get foot massages - and Best Foot Spa is the perfect place to do this. They can handle up to 6 customers in a single therapy room, and a total of 13 customers at one time. There are two couples rooms and a room that accomodates exactly 3 persons. I have gotten to know 2 other Best Foot Spa masseuses well (Carol & Lee) and they are also incredibly skilled.

You will get personal, kind and professional service at Best Foot Spa. This location is new and Rex is making every effort to make sure that 'everything is the best' at his new place.

My association with the relocated Dixie/Dundas Value Village began in January 2017, when I was invited to a pre-opening event because of my status as a Club Card member. It was a bit of a surprise walking in for the first time - the place was absolutely sprawling. From what I gathered at the time, this location is twice as big as the previous site across the street near the Talize.

The whole corner block has quickly turned into a hub for thrift stores - this site is now directly across the street from the Salvation Army and Talize (both of which I've spoken about in previous reviews). After visiting this Value Village frequently for the past three months, I'm confident in saying that this is now my new favorite in the city.

(As an aside, for those complaining about the lack of finds - this store was, and will continue to be, a prime target for resellers. At the pre-opening event, I watched a man run to the records section and immediately start hoarding a stack of LPs, most likely destined for eBay. It's the nature of the beast.)

The store is a bit overwhelming. Not only are there racks upon racks of clothing, but the specialty sections are surprisingly well-curated. I always make a beeline for the books whenever I come in, and I've been consistently surprised by the quality and selection of books. A thrift store is only as good as the donations it gets, and I've been impressed with the amount of content they get in. The vintage/collectible books section consistently has stuff that looks either brand-new or being sold at a significant loss (i.e. Folio Society books, signed books, Penguin collectible titles). The clothing itself is another high point - I've found everything from Brooks Brothers to Hugo Boss suits here, and a dizzying amount of shoes, jeans and other accessories.

Of course, the knick-knack section runs into the same problem as any other thrift store. Picked over and filled with broken or unusable items. To their credit, though, I almost always see employees restocking whenever I visit. I'm a bit more comfortable paying higher prices for thrifted goods when I know the selection is well-maintained and highly curated.

This Value Village has quickly turned into one of my favorite spots in the city to go thrifting at, and it's one I plan on visiting frequently for a long time to come.

Well worth checking out.",3,Jb13QyXGi0zD4ZtSTBQwpQ

When the line at BJ's was too long, we tried The Cabin.  There was no wait.  Now we know why!

There were four people in our party.  We arrived at the hostess stand.  No one was there.  We stood there for a couple of minutes before someone came over and told us to seat ourselves.  

Once seated, we waited 5 minutes before the waiter came over.  We placed our drink orders.  One water, one Shirley Temple, one Bud Light Draft and a Ginger Ale.  The water and Ginger Ale were fine.  The Bud Light had no foam/head on it at all.  Completely FLAT.  It looked like apple juice.  After explaining this to the waiter, he offered to put some salt in it to ""make it foam.""  What?!  He brought back another draft beer that looked the same as the first.  That one was sent back as well.  We requested a bottled beer, as it was clear that something was wrong with the draft.   Either there was no CO2 or the glass was soapy.  A side note, the bottled beer was lukewarm.  After another person in our party tried the Shirley Temple, we knew we had encountered another problem.  IT HAD LIQUOR.   A Shirley Temple does NOT have liquor!  Although the person consuming it was over the age of 21, a non-alcoholic beverage was NOT ordered nor desired.  The waiter confirmed that it was made with Gin. GIN?!    The Shirley Temple was sent back and a Sprite arrived 5 minutes later.

FOOD:  We ordered:  mac and cheese balls, chicken wings, potato skins and a chicken quesadilla.  

The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  It was all lukewarm.  It was all lacking in flavor.  

The potato skins looked good but did not match the description.  The description said, ""potato skins loaded with house smoked brisket and chili and topped with sharp cheddar cheese.""  THERE WAS NO BRISKET ON THE POTATO SKINS.  Also, the chili was really gross on the potato skin.  The skins had sour cream drizzled across them.  It would have been better on the side, not all over the top for folks that have allergies.

Mac and cheese balls were average.  The chicken wings were average.  The quesadilla was fair because the chicken inside was dry).  

There were quite a few employees just standing around, yet the service was abysmal.  We were never offered a discount after the drink disaster or the delays.  Never so much as an, ""I'm sorry."" 

Interesting note:  the couple at the table next to us had difficulty as well.  We overheard the first beer being sent back and complaints about their food (pulled pork was apparently dry).  They were waiting for friends to meet them at the restaurant and actually called the friends and told them not to come.

We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are obviously quite a few issues with this place.  Hopefully this experience will be reviewed by management and appropriate changes made.  If not, I don't see this place lasting 6 months.  What a disappointment!",6,hsRakdr_WTyvTGf7orKvlg

The casino area was old and worn out, I didn't eat at any of the restaurants out of fear of getting food poisoning. The 'adventuredome' was pathetic. Hardly any rides and the games were old and dirty looking. The 'skyline casino' was a random assortment of slot machines in the middle of a hallway. I see absolutely no reason why you would ever stay here. Honestly if your budget is so low that you can't afford to stay at Flamingo or Treasure Island then you shouldn't be visiting Vegas.

Two positives: they had a salmon in a lemon sauce that was TO DIE FOR, and a very good selection of meat, if you could get to it through all the elbows.

Our server was fun loving with a good knowledge of the restaurant's beer selection.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, seated immediately, and our order was taken soon after.

We started with the Alligator appetizer.  As many others have mentioned, this item is not on the menu, but is very popular.  It consists of fried breaded bits of alligator (about the size of popcorn chicken) served with a few French fries in a basket.  It comes with a spicy cocktail sauce to dip.

The server suggested that I order the crawfish etouffee and I was not disappointed.  A generous portion of shelled crawfish are covered with a spicy brown roux sauce with a mountain of moist dirty rice in the middle.  Adding some of the hot sauce from the table made it just the right temperature.

My experience is based on growing up eating at NYC's Curry Row (6th St B'twn 1st and 2nd Ave) then the few years in my late 20's living in Dirty Jersey I was exposed to a ton of great Indo-Paki restaurants. So, Why the background information? Simply put I'm cynical and spoiled and didn't expect the desert to have such BOMBay (ha-ha) Indian restaurants... But we do!
Okay, If Indian cuisine was bad Karaoke (metaphorically speaking.) and there was a contest like...American Idol; and I was on a panel with Simon, Paula, and Randy I know we would unanimously vote Mantra Masala-Healthy Cuisine from India, to be the next American Idol.
 There's never a wait and the prices are fair. (Dinner price-appetizer, variety of Nan, main course and drink 20-30$ per plate.) The service is prompt and extremely friendly. Tonight we brought a newbie to Indian cuisine and the owner (I think she was the owner?) She was nice enough to explain what's what to our friend. 
 Tonight I had the Chicken Vindaloo and I'm still thinking about how awesome it was. The Nan & Onion Culcha is made on site, piping hot and oh so good. The Samosa mixed appetizer is one you can't go wrong with. I gauge my restaurant on the Chicken Tikka Masla and Mantra Masala passes with flying colors. The Tikka & Tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy. The Mango Lassi and their Taj Beer are excellent (probably not together.) This place is extremely Vegetarian friendly.
 I'm psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week. The place has doubled in size within the last couple of months. It's a clean place with a dark and cozy atmosphere. The decor is a lot more modern then any other place I've been.

My theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in. Regardless, it was their fault.  I asked the owner if he would help me with the $450 tow truck bill, and he refused, despite the fact that it was his shop's incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a ""12,000 mile warranty.""  

So, make that $4,450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car.  Mistake learned.  My only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life.",14,x2QhSdw0TH0n88tDbcizgw

My friends had been giving me grief for years about living in Arizona since 1999 and never having been to the Grand Canyon - not that I even leave my zip code very often... 

After a recent, pretty severe round of ribbing from my friends, I went on line and discovered Arizona Scenic Tours. Reviews of the company and their tours were really good, and they offered exactly what I wanted, a one day Phoenix, Grand Canyon, and back day tour. Reviews of that particular tour made it sound like exactly what I wanted - an enjoyable tour with a great guide without me having to get behind the steering wheel to accomplish it.

I contacted Steve, the owner, to find about availability, and he was able to book me for a very reasonable priced upcoming tour with two couples. He arranged for the tour to pick me up at my house in Scottsdale at 7:30 am on tour day, and drop me off back at home upon arriving back in the area around 8:30 that evening. What easier way could there be to see the Grand Canyon, and get my friends off of my back.

I ended up having an enjoyable and enlightening day from start to finish. The tour guide, Mike, was friendly, affable, really knew his ""stuff"", was easy to listen to, and had great sense of humor. By the time he had all five of us on the tour in the van for a short while, we had become a comfortable and companionable group. 

We left the Phoenix area a little later than anticipated due to scattered pick up locations, but once on the road, we made good time. We learned that Mike had gone above and beyond the call of duty to arrange for a weather change from the rainy overcast day originally forecast for our tour, to a bright sunny one. Not every tour guide has those skills...

Our first stop was Montezuma's Castle. I had been there previously, but it was much more interesting with all of the information and details that Mike brought to the table - most of which I didn't learn on my original visit there. He made sure we gained admission quickly and conveniently, and that we got back on the road in a timely manner.

Arriving at, and leaving Montezuma's Castle, and throughout the trip, Mike made sure we were supplied with cold water, or soda if we preferred.

All along the way from Phoenix, to the Castle, on to the Grand Canyon stops, and back Mike filled in the drive with information about the various areas we were passing through, including changes in vegetation at various elevations. The entire tour was much more interesting than I had anticipated, and I found that the day passed quickly.

We visited overlooks at the Grand Canyon Village, Yavapai Point and Desert View Watchtower, each of which had unique views and attractions. There was plenty of time to grab food and take in the sights as we made the three stops. While not being intrusive, Mike was a wealth of information all along the way. I don't think I would have found the tour so interesting without the points that Mike was making.

We even got to see and photograph several mule dear as we waited in line at a stop sign leaving our initial lookout. They seemed not even to notice the traffic as it passed them. 

We left our final stop at the Desert View Watchtower at around 5:15 pm, and headed past the Little Colorado River Gorge, and along the scenic route through the colorful Painted Desert. 

The sun set as we reached the vicinity of Flagstaff, and there wasn't much left to see after that point, but it had been a great day. Traffic delays caused us to get back to the Phoenix area a bit later than anticipated, but we were all pleased not to have been part of the Labor Day traffic backed up in the direction from which we had come. 

It was a great day, and I am now considering doing the Sedona tour next!",5,1BcNXW9_Y16TIofPVpFqIA

After eating my long anticipated meal though, I thought better of it, realized that they were insanely busy, and that good food is worth waiting for. And it was indeed worth the wait!
Next time I'll definitely take J's advice and phone my order in, then come and pick it up later. 
Even with the place as busy as it was; and even though I had gotten a little cranky after my wait, the staff remained friendly, accommodating, and kept working up a storm. I'm not sure who was cooking the fish and chips in the back, but they must have been going full tilt, and J and his helper were quickly and efficiently taking orders in person and by phone, packing stuff to go, serving in house customers, and even cooking burgers at the counter for those who ordered them. And in all of it, J still made sure to give every person a nice comment, a thank you for coming, etc. 
Now for the food:  To put it simply; it was AMAZING. Juicy, tender fish, light batter, freshly made thick cut fries, and all piping hot still by the time I got home with it. All for an amazing price. I'm not much of a fish snob, so I just went with the haddock, and for $6 for a nice piece of fish and more fries than I expected, who could complain? They also offered many other specials, including a $9 halibut and chips, a $6 burger combo, etc. 
This was some of the best fish and chips I've had. None of that greasy ""it feels like someone painted the roof of my mouth with lard"" feeling during or after eating.  I will DEFINITELY be going back, and soon",1,Y6eCTUtSovaFs6p9L0R9sQ

The girl behind the counter looked like she loathed her job and was impatient with us since we weren't familiar with their ordering process. She robotically asked, ""how many doughnuts"" with a blank stare. We were new and we didn't have a set #, we were just shopping the display window and picking each variety as we go - are we terrible people?

We made rushed decisions and didn't feel welcomed to ask questions about the doughnuts. We ended up selecting 6 for $8. The doughnuts were good, but not life changing. I'm glad the doughnuts didn't taste like pure sugar but they could also use an extra edge or some sort of wow factor.

Doughnuts:
* Blueberry mousse - nothing too blueberry about the mousse, just the purple color and the blueberry garnish. The doughnut itself was very simple cake doughnut. 3/5

* Strawberry shortcake - very standard cake doughnut, using the same base like the above doughnut. Some white frosting drizzle and a little bit of tart and sweet chunky strawberry topping. The topping had small chunks of chopped strawberry and it really woke up the simple doughnut. Also finished with a dot of whipped cream on top. 4/5

* Cinnamon spice - standard cake doughnut simply coated in cinnamon sugar. It was a hair short of tasting like a churro. That's too bad. The dough was very doughy and dense. 2/5

* Buttermilk bar - tastes just like the classic - crispy glaze on the outside and doughy on the inside. 4/5 

* Classic glazed twist - tastes just like the classic, but oversized. You can't go wrong with this one. 4/5

They really didn't have a huge selection or variety tonight. I was looking for fun ones like the green tea or even the fat elvis one I saw on yelp. Nope, none of them showed up. They kept running out of flavors and taking doughnut cards down. Im not sure if that's a typical night for them or if I caught them on a bad night. Also, I'm truly troubled about returning to try their other specialty doughnuts. I would like to see the customer service cheer up a bit - I mean they are selling sweets not firearms after all.",20,u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ

The parking is a shared lot and quite small but I got a spot right away on a weekend for brunch. There were a lot of people waiting at the front (all waiting for their coffee to go) so I was seated immediately. Service was good from the moment we walked in. The barista at the front was friendly, as was our server. The wait for our food wasn't long at all, so that was great too. 

The menu is simple and straight forward so it was very easy for me to decide on what I wanted. My partner and I ordered the Platform Waffle and the Sunrise Waffle. They were both yummy but I preferred the Sunrise Waffle more. I think I spent too much time trying to take pictures of the Platform waffle because it got soggy (oops!)  The potato curls were soo addicting! I couldn't stop munching on these. The pricing is average at $15-16 for each waffle. 

Of course, I had to order something to drink at Platform Espresso Bar. I ended up ordering a cappuccino. They were supposed to have two types of espresso to choose from but as they were in between seasons, there was only one in stock, which I was completely fine with. Taste was alright.

In conclusion, it's a cute little shop I would return to, but I wouldn't make it one of my regular stops.",2,Dt_h4Dt0lVblqRxLLV25YQ

Now the food ...

I presented symptoms of what I thought to be an upper respiratory infection: facial pain, chills, low grade fever, aching throat, chest pain and wheezing while breathing. Went into this place and was seen within 40 minutes, and presented all of these symptoms to a doctor in residency. Was given an in office treatment of albuterol  via a nebulizer after a series of absurd questions regarding symptoms I didn't have. Bear in mind this was from the supervising doctor and not the doctor in residency, who actually attempted an examination. 

Doc: ""do you have asthma?"" 
Me: ""no""
Doc: ""are you sure?""
Me: ""still no""

After that treatment, which I admittedly didn't well to, I was asked about some other symptoms. At this point I wanted antibiotics, as this is usually what is prescribed for my frequent upper respiratory infections

Doc: ""are you coughing?"" 
Me: ""no""
Doc: ""we're going to give you some prescription cough suppressant"" 
Me: ""I don't have a cough; can I have some amoxicillin? That's usually what I get prescribed"" 
Doc, clearly annoyed: ""yeah sure but take the cough medicine"". 

Get to the pharmacy; low and behold, no antibiotics have been prescribed. This is day 6 with no symptom relief and nothing but cough suppressants for a cough I didn't have and continue not to have; turns out I have a sinus infections that can only be cured with....wait for it....amoxicillin! Jesus jet fuel Christ, if I had a broken rib would I be given medication for heart burn? Or if I had appendicitis, would you send me on my way with Advil and some juice? 

 Medicine should not be dictated on narrowed views of how medicine should be administered and gut feelings. 

I would not recommend this place, not because of waits, over charging, or any other of the complaints on Yelp; don't go here if you want care for the illness you have. My care was a series of random guesses based on symptoms I never presented (I still don't have asthma). I somewhat get the aversion to prescribing antibiotics , especially during flu season, but they were developed for a reason. To help you body get past an illness. If a medical professional won't help get you past your illness for what ever reason, then they have ceased being useful to you.",1,u0k0wmO399--zSv1nLnTXQ

More times than not they stand around talking to each other and act annoyed if you interrupt to ask a question. When they do take a minute to ""help"" the customer they are usually still talking to another employee or looking off in the distance without talking to the customer. The impression is that they all hate their jobs.

More than once I bought an item in the pharmacy department that had a sign indicating that it was on sale. When the cashier rang it up for the regular price they actually argued with me that it was my mistake and refused to do a price check. When I went back later and took a picture of the sign, the service desk people told me ""that sign wasn't supposed to be there"" and would not refund the difference.

The downward spiral of Costco isn't just limited to this one store. I bought one item there based solely on a claim in Costco's ad that it featured an advantage that the competition didn't have. I paid big premium price for the item that could be bought anywhere else for a fraction of the price. When I got it home I discovered that the feature had been misrepresented by Costco. I checked the manufacturer's website to verify then emailed the manufacturer to confirm. They replied promptly and verified that the product Costco sold me was not as represented and instructed me to take it back for a refund. When I did the returns clerk did not want to listen to the reason I was returning it indicating that Costco's policy was ""no questions asked"".

I wanted to help other customers from being duped so I wrote a letter to Costco customer service. After a month in which they ignored me I wrote a review of the product at the Costco website. Costco removed it the next day. I wrote another and they did it again and then the same thing with a third ... all because of my effort to simply help other people understand that the product was not what they expect. After the third rejection I wrote I letter to Costco's executive offices. Guess what? Yes, you guessed it ... they also ignored me.

So much for Costco's legendary customer service. RIP",4,Pj9YpaP0T7A_5S_PT8IpNg

We got seated pretty quickly but thereafter service was extremely lacking. We waited 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and then is was only to bring us water. We stopped one of the hosts asking if we had a waiter and he curtly replied ""I'm working on that."" No apology, no sense of hospitality. There were also some staff members arranging and rearranging empty tables and place settings and they did so without acknowledging any customers. A few minutes later one of them came to take drink orders and, again, there was no acknowledgement for how long we had been waiting. There was also some mix up with our drinks; one of the servers served two of us our drinks then proceeded to switch them, take them back, and switch them again. This could have easily been avoided by asking ""who had Chardonnay?"" etc. 

We eventually had someone come and take our food orders and our experience was relatively issue free after that. There was also a mix up with our bill but, to her credit, our waitress was helpful and understanding in this situation. 

I tried to be understanding, this was Mother's Day and graduation weekend, after all. However the restaurant was far from full and there seemed to be more than enough staff so I do not quite understand what the problem was. A gentleman at another table had to get up to find someone to let them know that they were ready to place their order because they hasn't seen their waiter.

The hibachi was entertaining, but we've experienced better.

We ordered the hamachi kama, a small sashimi tray, their tempura dinner, and their Gonoe roll. None of it was good on value. The sashimi tray had less variety than the sashimi dinner I ordered last time. The salmon had connective tissue in it. It was quite underwhelming. Their tempura dinner, while tasty, is considerably smaller than I recall it being, so it's not a good deal anymore. Their Gonoe roll, while looking impressive, is quite expensive and doesn't stand out as being particularly tasty. Our first order of hamachi kama was slightly raw on the inside, so we let the waitress know and she had them redo it for us. The first time, the fish didn't come piping hot. The second time, it did. That tells me they struggle with consistency. The portion was alright for price, but not great.

While service was alright, it also confused me. I've never had servers pass me food over table partitions before.

We are very pissed off that our stay was very terrible. When we got to our room the power was not working and we notified the front desk of the situation. They didn't send anyone upstairs to fix the problem. So I let the front desk know that I should be compensated in some way about this situation. I notified them that husband's my step dad does work at the Marriott and that I would be notifying him about this situation. The front desk said they would comp my breakfast. Later on that night I came into the hotel and informed the front desk that I lost my key and that I needed a key to get into my room and I also let the guy at the front desk know that I needed to move my car because there was a white suv suburban that was parked right next to my car and they were partying and having sex by my car, and I also needed the key as well to move my car into the garage, where I felt my car would be safer at. 

The next morning when I went to check out and eat the comp breakfast, when the two front desk staff asked the lady manager about it because it wasn't in the note, the lady manager seemed pretty upset that I got the breakfast. Which means the manager from the night before again didn't do his job far as getting me into another room or sending some one upstairs to fix or see about the problem or put in the notes for the next morning that me in my wife was suppose to get our free breakfast. Which takes me to my next problem, the manager reported a false report saying I came to the front desk at 4am saying people were after me, which I never told him that at all. I asked him for my room key and notified him that I lost it at the nightclub and if I may please get a new key. Which again if I said some people were after me, why didn't he call 911? If that was the case if I was in need of help. 

So a week after our stay, (9/10/16) my husband's step dad, who gave us the Marriott Family and Friends Form, notified me that the hotel reported this back to his job about issues with my stay, and let me know that he is very upset with me. I'm very upset that these false reports were made about me in my wife stay and I would love for my step dad name and my name be cleared from these false reports. I would love for his boss to be called at the Monterey Marriott and his name be cleared due to the managers miss handling this problem. My step dad has been working at the Marriott for over 25yrs and I wouldn't want him to lose his job over these false accusations or have him on bad terms with his manager, have his name slandered, and have his friends in family rate forms suspended. I demand a response from HR office or general manager on this matter asap.

This just shows how simple things such as Ramen is not easy to imitate by wannabes.  You can't just put mayo and yum yum sauce to cover crap up.  

I have read beforehand  that the owner of this establishment is Hawaiian Japanese nisei or sansei.  As Ramen is sort of a ""soul food"" for Japanese people, this was a source of slight concern for me, as many nisei, sansei, etc,in this country are not as well versed in the Japanese language and culture as they think they are.  But all the background info aside, I wanted to see what Bachi folks' interpretation of ramen was so here is my take on this place. 

The decor is modern chic, not very Ramen-ya like, but it's a cozy place.  The menu is written in Japanese/English, and the Japanese part of the menu gave away that the owner is not a native speaker.  My daughter and I look at each other with a look of concern, but we said ""as long as it tastes good"".....but it baffles me why the owner didn't have a native speaker proofread something as important as a menu; imagine reading a menu with a bunch of typos.  Most people won't even notice this but it tells ME something about attention to details.  

We ordered an appetizer of gyoza and I had tonkotsu, she had buta-san, which is basically a tonkotsu ramen with extra chasyu.  

Gyoza was not bad.  Not Monta quality but satisfactory.  They also have a ""gyoza sauce"", but a lot of us like to make our own by mixing soy sauce and rice vinegar along with rayu and I'm personally not very fond of pre-made ones.  

Also, you are asked whether we wanted our noodle firm or soft.  Firm, I ordered, as it should be, I""m not sure who would want a ramen noodle to be soft.   That's just wrong to me.  It's not the way ramen noodle is supposed to be.  

So the ramen....I don't even know where to start with this.  The broth was not all there. Actually, it wasn't there AT ALL.  It tasted thin, unsavory, hardly any umami, and was void of any rich tonkotsu flavor that it was supposed to have.  The menu said ""hakata-style"" but I can see someone from Hakata feeling quite insulted by this.  If I put a bunch of MSG in chicken broth it might taste like this.  

The noodle....WTF.  It was floppy, soft, and had absolutely no KOSHI, which is a term used to describe, not exactly firmness, but the quality of rebound or crispness you feel when you bite into it, and I ordered a FIRM??  I couldn't tell if this was a problem of having poor quality noodle or was just horrendously overcooked, but I have a feeling that it was both.  I think packaged ramens have better quality noodle.  

The two main components or ramen are noodle and soup/broth, just as Nigiri Sushi has rice/shari and fish/tane, and just as nigiri sushi, the harmony between those two parts is the very important 3rd component of any good ramen.  This ramen had zero out of three.  I was trying to decide between 1 or 2 stars, but I would have to go with 1 given the quality of this ramen.  It is with great sadness that I have to leave such a review, but I have to be truthful, and for those who are familiar with my reviews, I stress authenticity quite a bit, but this ramen is at a level where authenticity is not even relevant.  It's anime ramen level.  It's not something you expect out of a place that specializes in ramen.  I'm at a loss for words here.  

As much as I enjoy recent boom of authentic Japanese restaurants in this town, I just as much, if not more, resent wannabes who try to ride the bandwagon and I must say that this is one such case.  The other reviewers who spoke highly of this place should really revisit monta, sora, and fukumimi and listen to their palates.  Shoku is not in the same league as the above 3.  IMHO, it ain't even in the same ball park or the same sport.",21,I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA

The first time we tried to have dinner at Superica, on a Saturday,the wait was more than an hour and we left. Cut to the following Tuesday, my coworker and I decided to pow wow after work and I suggested we try Superica again. We had back up plans prepared just in case. Turns out we were super lucky to be seated right away and we secured awesome parking easily, too! 

The atmosphere was very different than other places in Charlotte. We joked that there should have been tumbleweeds crossing on the video that was playing on the projector. The restaurant has great attention to detail from the complimentary matches to the beautiful bathrooms. 

We each ordered a drink and got down to business with the menu. The sangria was not very strong but I would recommend their house blended margarita. Sneaky, sneaky. One more and I would've been giggly all night. 

I love that we received chips and salsa to start. The chips were crisp and thin, both salsas were fresh and added flavor to our meal. The presentation of the salsas with descriptions of each was a nice surprise. Not just a filler item, no stale chips and jarred salsa here. We each ordered fajitas with queso fundido to start. It was an insane amount of food. You are definitely getting what you pay for and can choose to share an order of fajitas between two people. The mixed fajitas with shrimp would be my top choice for the shrimp alone! Each shrimp has a sliver of jalapeño tucked into the backside and then wrapped in bacon and I'm assuming deep fried. Ooh... just give me those skrimps! The queso is worth the hype and is great on its own but there are options for toppings. Both plates came with warm tortillas. The fajitas come with an array of toppings, rice and beans with cheese. Do not skip the beans. I ""don't like"" beans. Mm-hmm. Not anymore. Superica's refried beans are topped with cheese and popped under the salamander to become a melty, toasty, dip-able side. Friend, turns out I like refried beans. 

Make sure to check out my picture of my to go box. I'm not kidding when I say I had a ton of food. I went home with enough to eat another meal. We spent a pretty penny: $108 before tip for two with an app, 2 meals and 4 cocktails. And still I say I can't wait to come back!

To get here, you can jump on a shuttle at the airport or long term parking, in order to rent a car. The shuttle is about every 15 minutes. If you are not an Emerald member, you will need to check-in at the National Car Rental counter, in order to get your car. If you're an Emerald member, you simply follow the signage to the garage. Pick any car located in the Emerald Aisle. I prefer 4-door sedans with enclosed trunks, since I want to keep my luggage hidden, until I can check into my hotel. SUVs are nice, but there's no cover to hide your stuff you store in the back. National Car Rental usually has nice, new cars available. Every car that I've rented, in the last 3 years, has been new. Some still had all their fresh-off-the-fleet pastic covers on them. No complaints here!

When you pick your ride (typically an intermediate sized car), be sure to do the following:
-Adjust your rear and side view mirrors.
-Verify the amount of gas in your tank. If it's not full, be sure to let the person at the exit gate know.
-Check for any damage around the car.
-Make sure that the hood of your car is closed properly!

Seriously, check the hood of your car is closed properly. I've had 2 instances when they haven't been properly shut. Both times, I didn't notice it until I had left the lot. Pulling over to the side of a road to do so would be a problem. 

When you leave the lot, you stop by the check-out booth. As an Emerald member, simply providing your drivers license. They'll scan the car and match your name to your reservation and then you're off. I've never had an issue with any of the cars breaking down.  

Return is easy for everyone. Return to the rental car lot. Pull into one of many lanes at the National Car Rental floor in the garage. An attendant will scan your car. Get your receipt and you'red done!",3,mwpqciBkHxE2MBw4bjKqpA

I've always been greeted with fast friendly service at reasonable prices.  I am so consistently pleased that when I was in the market for new tires before one went flat I went straight here knowing I wouldn't be ripped off.

Be advised they do not make appointments.  It's a first come, first served business.  There is also very little parking.  I would recommend calling ahead if you are looking for specific tires to make sure they are in stock (or can be ordered) before you arrive.  When it's busy they will be honest about the wait.  I went for new tires a few months ago and was told there was a good two and a half hour wait.  I decided to leave and come back a few days later when the wait was only around 30 minutes.  They do a brisk business and even on my return trip (I arrived a few minutes before they officially opened) I was the fourth person in the waiting room.

I recommend Laurel Gardens Tire Service to anyone looking for new tires.  It's a great small family-run business that gets you back on the road fast.",1,WoKCLSctS7G2547xKcED-Q

Some of the people can get a little feisty. I've seen lots of loud words exchanged. People can get real opinionated about how things ought to be running. Reciting rules and making a big fuss if someone isn't aware of one of the rules and is breaking it. For instance bringing food into the dog park is enough to get yelled at even if it's in your bag and dogs are to be fully vaccinated before coming. I appreciate the rules and yes I would like them followed as well. One time I was there a man started feeding my dog his human ice cream and I wasn't pleased but all you need to do is to politely ask people not to do these things like I did. He stopped after I asked and fortunately my dog was fine. But yes you should never feed anyone else's dog any food without asking EVER even dog treats! I came once at night around 6 and never again. My dog was attacked right when he came in the gate. Fortunately he wasn't hurt but he was real shook up and we had to leave. And this dog was going around attacking all the dogs that got near it. You really shouldn't bring a dog like that to a dog park. The dogs at night at least the one night I went seem a little out of control and there are so many of them too. It's best to come here during the day when the better behaved dogs are here and not quite so crazy. Yes, there is a lot of poop that doesn't get picked up and I've stepped in it before. Nothing worse than stepping in dog poop without anything to clean it off with. So watch your step. Some dog parks I go to I have to pick things out of my dogs hair after we leave and some times it takes days to get out, but here I don't have that problem. The worse that has happened is he rolls around in the dead grass and that gets stuck to him for a little while but it all falls out within an hour or two. My dog really enjoys rolling around in the grass too. I come to this one so frequently because it's so big and it's the closest dog park to my house. My dog really enjoys socializing and there is always dogs here no matter when you come. So I'm sure you have read about the chair people and no I'm not in their clique, but they have always been quite friendly to me and they aren't nazis like some of the other reviewers make them out to be. They normally get to the park between 1 and 2. They set up their circle and haven't ever been rude to me. I appreciate them bringing their big cooler of water that all the dogs drink from. In fact when we come in they normally say hi to my dog when we first walk in. Yes I have seen people smoking inside the dog park and I don't mind, afterall we are outside, and it's vegas anyways even if we weren't outside, but if you are a smoker try to be considerate of others and smoke in an area where there aren't a lot of people around and throw away your butts when you are done. This is a dog park and dogs eat anything off the ground.",2,yFelAlXODSB_Hy2PyHXViA

The people watching is very entertaining. Women who were past their due date but proudly display the silicone and gingerly step in 6 inch heels supported by matchstick stems. Men who were overtly comfortable with showing of their fashion palate. Couples who owned the room next to ones who seem more timid than bambi in a forest fire. 

Anyways, still just an exciting atmosphere. The place is split into a long bar, backlit pink and a long set of dining tables seating 2-4. The sakitini menu is impressive and worth a try despite the obvious mark-up.

Foodwise, you're really expecting much? Okay. As for the famed ebi shooter that EVERYONE seems to rave about? OVERRATED. I can see it being novel for some people who don't dine much but seriously, it is an oversized hand-roll with shrimp, tempura bits and a soy wrap shell. If this is their signature piece, they need a new gimmick. Bottomline, avoid it and if you really want, lie and tell people you had it.

Their food is bipolar as well. The hot plates were extremely mediocre. Everything is salted to the hilt. Perhaps the top fell off the shaker? We tried the black cod which was very tender, but nearly salt-infused. The egglant shrimp plate was even worse. Not edible.

Ahh.....but the good stuff. Their nigri is fresh and their maki ($13/roll) are well constructed and flavorful. Especially their orange and black and hotate tuna rolls. Very nice...saved the night.

Overall, this place has its warts. But then again, the atmosphere is definitely impressive, people watch, knock back some overpriced sake and order the maki.  Three stars this time, but I could make it four next time.",3,TZelLnaGbHgaG7LBI6rfgg

It really is a good spot that is close to downtown but in a pretty quiet area. 

The new ownership is a step up from the previous owners and property managers, however, they are not without their faults. In July, I had my air conditioning break during the day and I came home from work to a 98 degree apartment. I promptly called maintenance and informed them of the issue. They were very prompt in returning my call and offered a stand alone unit for the night to make it bearable. 

After a few minutes the maintenance man (I can't recall his name) came to my door and informed me that the stand alone unit had already be given to another resident who had a broken unit by another maintenance employee. He was nice and very apologetic and offered to give me the keys to an empty unit that had A/C, I declined as I did not intend to sleep on the floor for the evening in an apartment that literally had nothing in it. Needless to say, I slept at a friend's house and returned to a cool apartment when I got home the next day! The maintenance department was awesome during this and did the best they could with limited resources and support from the property managers. 

Now, as I mentioned the A/C had broken through the day and was running all day trying to cool the apartment. Obviously, my electric usage went through the roof with the unit running all day. I brought this to the attention of ""Roxy"" and asked if there was anything that could be done in terms of compensation because 1) My electric bill was sure to skyrocket and 2) I had been displaced for the evening.

When I spoke with her she was rather rude and told me that because they had offered the empty unit as a place to sleep that they wouldn't compensate me in any way. I was somewhat taken aback by this as they were unable to accommodate me in my own unit for the evening and fully expected me to sleep on the floor of an empty unit. I wasn't looking for anything extreme like a free month of rent, simply something to help me offset the cost of an A/C unit running for 8+ hours ( maybe $50 off?). 

I almost feel bad leaving this review, however, their handling of this situation (especially when they are trying to retain tenants) was comical. I have not had an issue with any staff members outside of Roxy. In fact, I would goes as far as to say that the rest of the staff is the nicest I've ever come across at an apartment complex. I understand that Roxy may have been restricted my ownership policies, however, a simple smile and being nice really could have swayed my opinion in a positive direction.",12,mFL__p62jDVqQWsbdAiRwQ

During the big names it can get a bit congested in there and potentially unsafe with the amount of people they cram inside. I typically choose to sit those out.
I really like seeing the yet-not-so-big-names! The crowd will usually be smaller and typically those artists will hang around to meet and greet... AND you get to learn about someone before they become a huge name and may never come back to a small stage...

There are several bars from front to back, and during bigger shows they'll pull out the standalone beer tubs ... so you're never too far away from another ice cold beer! Speaking of beer, they don't have any fancy craft beer - just your standard beer choices. But, hey.. it's perty durn cheap!! ONE TIP: BARS ARE CASH ONLY! BRING CASH. They do offer ATM useage which does come with a $2 dollar fee to pull out some more Jacksons.

*Wednesday: Ladie's Night (ladies in free) and Free line dance lessons at 7pm followed by 
   music by the house band Out Of The Blue, and occasional concerts by smaller artists as well.
*Friday, Saturday: Swap back and forth for ""1-2-3 Nights"" (see website for more details) and

I am so thankful that I finally found a keeper.  This salon is amazing.  I had a set of acrylics put on by another salon 2 weeks ago along with a pedicure.  I was so dissappointed by the results, my nails looked like ducks feet.  The pedicure after 1 week was already chipping.  My husband was in desperate need of a pedicure and so I got on line to see what I could find based on others recommedations.  I am so thankful that I found Highlights Nails and Spa on Yelp.  My husband and I had our first appt this afternoon.  What a treat.  If you want one of the best Pedicures, treat yourself to Cindy. She was absolutely amazing and my husbands rough feet are now smooth!  Now guys, if you don't think this is for you, not manly enough, etc, my husband is one to tell you to try it.  A pedicure with a massage truly is amazing after a working on your feet.  (Guys, my hubby is as bad-ass as they get and he is sold and is going to go once a month)  Now for the rest of the experience, I mentioned my acrylic nails done by the other spa to Ali the owner.  She went and got her glasses as I was getting my pedicure, came back, took my hands and looked at my nails.  She said she could fix them.  OMG, she spent quite a bit of time working on them, they had to be completely refiled, shaped and gel put back on them. She really spent time and work on them and I have to say they haven't ever looked and felt better.  I was joking that I should have made a hair appt. as the stylist Nicole had just finished an up do on a customer that was adorable.  (My arm is in a cast right now so doing my own hair is pretty difficult), after making this comment jokinly to the owner, the next thing I know, Nicole has her straightener and blow dryer in hand and fixed my hair!  Cindy then came over and put two adorable flowers on my nails.   Brandi did my pedicure and my nails and feet feel fabulous.  I left there thinking I had just spent a luxurious day at a first class spa.  This is one of the cleanest most comfortable spas I have been to.  Their commitment to customer satisfaction is something that has been amiss at other spas in the area that I have tried.  

My husband and I rarely refer anybody or any business to friends and family, but felt compelled to share our experience regarding the treatment we received today at Highlights.

I give the food a 7/8 out of 10.  I had ""Saucy Balls"" (4 meatballs in sauce) and a wedge salad.  

It's apparently impossible to get 2 pork meatballs and 2 beef meatballs.  This is unfortunate because it doesn't let me try a wider variety of your food and also because it's unbelievably easy to accommodate.  I should be able to get 4 different kinds of meatballs if I want.  Seriously?

I didn't eat in the restaurant but it seemed to be having the usual identity crisis that most Pittsburgh restaurants and bars have.  Half upscale, half sports bar.  Nice decor, ESPN on a TV.  Make a choice and stick with it.

My comparisons were easy to make because there's a meatball only restaurant in my town (24th & Meatballs) that does a much better job and has been doing it for longer (i.e. I'm sure this place is probably a rip off).  I have no problem with that but a 2nd generation restaurant has every opportunity to do it better.

Fast forward to last week, my wife and I decided to put a clear tint on my master bedroom French door windows that leads to our balcony. We wanted to do the Llumar Air 80 which we have on our front auto windshield. It is almost completely clear which should not affect our HOA as it is not reflective or dark in any way. Our main reason for wanting to do this  is for heat and UV rejection as those windows are facing west and a massive amount of heat comes into the room and whole house every afternoon til the evening hours. I remembered Brian did a standout job on our auto so I gave him a call. Surprisingly, he still remembered us and got us a quote very quickly with just the glass measurements. Made an appointment to get the job done and he was at my house bright and early the following Monday when I was available. 

You can tell Brian loves what he does by watching the way he works. He started by trimming off all the excess glue around the window panes (glue has been there since day one when the house was built and the builders just left it like that). After that he covers the floors with plastic and sprayed soap and water on the glass and cleaned it all immaculately and carefully. If the tint was to come out perfectly he had to prep it well which he did spend a good amount of time doing. Finally the tint was put on, trimmed and bubbles squeegeed out. All in all it took a good couple of hours to do just two large windows but the results are fantastic! Room temperature was cooler almost immediately and we can really feel the difference! I'm sure this will help with our air conditioning and cooling costs but most importantly is our comfort level and with the curtains back and the blinds up, it just looks so great! 

Thanks Brian for another wonderful job! I will definitely come back to you in the future for all our tinting needs!",1,rVp_G2QBx681UMpC2lKgeg

Since I've had experience with purchasing bulk wine, the owner went right into wine tasting with us (which I appreciated as a similar store in Ossington doesn't have the service). We picked our wine and at under $5 per bottle, we left the store excited yet disappointed as it was a 3 month wait! 

Beer wait = 2 weeks
Wine wait = 3 months

3 months later (aka yesterday), my friend and I received a call and our wine was finally ready. Charles was very accommodating as we asked for a last minute slot and he trusted us that we were going to be done early and told us to head over. The bottling process was very straight forward. They had a machine which filled up the bottles for you and you cork it yourself. If you want your wine bottle to be fancier, you can shrink wrap the top of your bottle. 

Staff was very friendly and the space was big but, we had two other people who were bottling at the same time as well as customers coming through the door so it got a little bit hectic.

I knew that it would take some time to have our order delivered and I wasn't upset about this.  When I was checking out, their site gave me an option to leave a note or a message.  I stated that if they were able to deliver earlier that it would be greatly appreciated because I was expecting and very hungry.

I walked in and left a little while later with an amazing tint job. I went with ceramic tint. My car was a tight fit (Fiat 500 Abarth) but the tint looks flawless. I've had tints done numerous times over the past few years and this tint install is the best I've had. Super clean shop too. Nice waiting area too. The prices was pretty good but at the same time there are certain things that you get what you pay for. At DC I think you get a little more than you pay for. Premium product with above premium service and shop. I highly recommend this place.,0,K4QTDR5w4CkTOTwlm6O01A

I was solo and tasted their Nutella Latte, served under a doily, with a spoonful of Nutella presented across the cup, ($4.25) and a single savoury Portuguese pastry (they range from $1.00-1.80) served in a handwoven mini basket.

First, we walked in the door to be blasted with the heat of the office.  It's 50 degrees outside and 85 inside.  If that is not bad enough the African American girl behind the desk was a smoker and you could smell her from the front door.  The stench was so strong I had to keep leaving the waiting room because of the cigarette odor.  To make things worse, she got up twice during the time I was waiting and went  outside to smoke more, so each time she came back in the smell in the room just kept getting worse and worse.  The smell traveled all the way down to the waiting rooms after we got in to see the doctor.  This made the whole location seem disgusting and dirty.

Second, as I said it was hot, oppressively hot.  After that they put myself, my wife and my daughter in a 12 by 12 room and closed the door the heat kept building to the point my daughter started to feel light headed.  When I asked them to at least leave the door open, they said it was against hippa laws to leave the door open.  

The doctor was fine, but when all got home we all had to take a shower and put our clothes straight into the washing machine.  This visit left my family and I completely grossed out.  Not the kind of feeling you want from a medical facility.",1,Uh7uuynOGWZtVX_HTogyfw

As I attend a few trade shows each year at the convention center across the street the Envy Steakhouse is a life saver as it's a great spot to take clients for a business  lunch in a casual yet classy environment. As those who have done shows at the convention center know the food there is pretty much the standard fast food slop. It's an easy walk over to Envy to enjoy a proper lunch and get off the show floor for a little while. Always good to get re-energized with some decent food before heading back to the grind.

During lunch hours they offer a menu of items from their Grill 55. It's not an overly large menu but has just the right amount to choose from. Comfort food classics mixed in with some American cuisine foods, along with a wine and cocktail selection. Service is very attentive and professional. The food comes out pretty quick. Both times I was here this past week during the Infocomm Show I ordered the Mediterranean Salad - Arugula, Heirloom Tomatoes, Kalamata Olives, 
Bocconcini Mozzarella, Glazed Pistachios, dressed with Local Honey Basil Balsamic Vinaigrette and Grilled Salmon on top. Nice plate of food that was pretty tasty and not gut busting - especially when having to go back to work the convention center!

I've used my fair share of gyms around the world and Toronto (Equinox, Gold's, Club One, Extreme, Kingwest, 99 Sudbury, etc.) and I have to say I find TYC pretty top notch. 

Yeah, it's not cheap, but you can find a pretty decent deal for what you get - considering all classes are free, including yoga and pilates. I don't even do classes regularly and find it to be good value. 

What I like:

1) Unlike some of the reviewers and my experience at other gyms, I've never felt like I was being sold or pushed anything. I've actually gotten advice and short sessions from trainers for free, without even a mention of buying follow-on sessions
2) I usually show up fairly late in the evening and love the emptiness mentioned in the other review. I basically see some subset of the same 10 people there any given evening, but if you want to socialize rather than work out just show up at 6pm, the place is full of good looking people
3) Equipment is new, fully stocked, clean, and always in working condition
4) Every staff member I've interacted with has been excellent - courteous and helpful. Like I said I don't go to the gym to socialize, but the members I've bumped into have generally been nice enough
5) Gym, locker room, and showers, kept surprisingly clean 
6) Free underground parking is key; especially in the winter when you can tend to get too lazy to face the cold, and you can stop by whole foods on your way back to your car

I don't think I'll be switching gyms anytime soon but if I had to, the only other one I'd consider is 99 Sudbury; new and still working out some kinks, but lots of potential",3,rD2tJLlrXnyLnc8X0GPlEg

She was also very careful to explain that if they filled up and people came in who wanted to pay for the seats and daybeds, they'd have to start bumping people. No problem and props for being upfront about it. We took over a daybed that was right at the edge of the water. The pool area is a bit on the small side, but not nearly as small as Tao and Azure. The music was good. Drinks were about what we expected to pay. The server was really awesome. We only left because we got hungry and since it started getting cloudy, we got a little cold. If you want to get a lot of sun, I suggest staying on the side that you walk in from; the other side gets shaded by the building a lot (which is good if you're looking for shade).

Service is exceptional! I came here with my love and we love our oysters. We got a dozen oysters. They easily slide out of the shell and directly in my mouth. Yummmm yummm just remembering it gives me the goosebumps .. I wished I had some right now!! Lol. I had a beautiful meal last time except for the octopus .. I have to say it was not their best meal! The cook was overcooked and it turned out super chewy. 
It was even very cold. Kind of surprised that it was overcooked at a top executive restaurant owned by the famous Chuck Hughes!! Hmmm bummer. Ok on the pro side Their Mushroom risotto was succulent warm and freshly prepared. I had to order a second order of that amazing risotto! 

Another thing I don't like is how their menu is written on their board. It's so small I can barely see what they have and theres absolutely no bright lights in the resto. It's kindove a drag having to figure out what the hell is on their menu. I admit its hard to get a hard copy of their menu because they change it daily but maybe they should change their board to a light board with markers instead of the dreadful chalk board. 

Service was splendid! We always get amazing service over here. I think the manager knows us very well and he always makes sure to get us the best available table and makes sure to get us the drinks we ask for.

The restaurant is quite dark and loud, but that's not really a huge bother to us.  Ambience was nice.

We ordered the Scallop appetizer to split - this was quite good, the scallop was perfectly cooked and we both enjoyed it.

We each had a glass of the house red, which was quite nice and at a good price (9.99) which was welcome here.

For the second course I had the veal stuffed raviolini with pistachios and my fiancee had the mushroom risotto.  My raviolini was quite good, even though the veal portion was almost undetectable.  The risotto was however quite bland.

For the main course my fiancee had the rack of lamb and I had the osso bucco.  The lamb was very good - perfectly cooked, well seasoned, everything you would expect.  The osso bucco was however probably the least tender osso bucco I've ever had, and also there was basically no flavour to it whatsoever - it basically tasted like un-seasoned stewing meat, and the bed of risotto it was on had the same flavour as the risotto from the second course.  I had to salt the dish, and only ended up eating less than half of it.

We decided against dessert.  I asked for the bill, and then we didn't see the waiter for another 20 minutes, when he came over and asked again if we wanted the bill.

Overall, the place was very hit and miss.  Although some dishes were excellent, when spending over $200.00 on a dinner, you don't expect two fifths of the meal to be bland, tasteless and uninspired.

I love all of the little nooks and spaces! Nice little patio, the bathroom was clean, the server was friendly, the DJ was decent, and there is lots of parking right there! 

As I came by here after an after party, I needed no further booze and something to eat on the quick. I ordered a Pepsi and a poutine. The poutine was okay. Decent size, not even close to authentic, but good to absorb the alcohol in my stomach. Had I been completely sober, I probably would have been disappointed. Now as for the pop... 

Herein lies one of my big pet peeves with bar and restaurant staff that use a soda gun. First of all, the Pepsi was $2.50 for a standard size glass. Fine. After I was finished my poutine, nearly done my Pepsi, and my friend was about 2/3 done his beer the waitress took the empty plate and asked if I wanted ""a refill"" on my pop. I looked at the glass thinking we'd be leaving soon but figured while she's there and asking I might as well so said, ""sure, why not"". When the bill came I was charged for two Pepsis. Now aside from the fact that that is just plain cheap - considering the actual cost of the drink is about 5-cents - it's rather irritating. I would not have accepted the offer of ""a refill"" had I been aware that I would be charged. Generally, if I say I would like ""another one"" I expect to pay. If it's ""a refill"", the assumption is that they are refilling the glass that I already paid for. Whatever. Now I know. And you do too.

We went with a party of eight foodies. Fortunately for me, everyone loved to share and I was able to taste a bit of everything. Each dish I tried was better than the last, from appetizers through dessert. 

The French onion soup was a special favorite, and might truly be the best version of this soup I've ever had. Even the broth was scrumptious. But the goblet it comes in is HUGE. Share this one!

The tuna tartare was a pleasant surprise! I'm not usually a fish fan, so I was delighted to find this dish so tasty. 

The duck wings with orange sauce are out of this world! Just do yourself a favor and order it, and don't forget to dunk a bite in the yummy hollandaise sauce served in a little orange half. Mmmmm!

The filet mignon was perfection. So tender, so tasty. And the fries served with it (frites) were so rich and delectable -- no doubt thanks to the beef fat they are cooked in. 

For dessert, I tried the rum cake and the creme brûlée. The rum cake was a bit strong for me, but that creme brûlée was fantastic. It hardly lasted a full minute on the table before being gulped up. 

This place is superb. Can't wait to come back and try brunch!",1,Wy1QW1iUzTYVw0jw970sUg

We found Brew on Yelp (duh) and I was excited to see what the commotion was about. Service here is stellar; Sou (I'm sorry if I spelled that wrong!) saw us staring at the menu and came around the counter to suggest some drinks. I decided on the Okinawa milk tea (brown sugar flavor) with boba at normal sweetness, and my boyfriend got the mango green tea at normal sweetness. We also got the classic crepe with whipped cream (bananas, Nutella, strawberries). As we waited for everything to come out (and it wasn't much of a wait despite the crowd), Sou let me sample the lychee jelly and the pudding (I'm coming back for a tea with that jelly in it!) I could go on and on about his customer service skills, but let's just say that we felt welcome here. 

Both drinks were phenomenal. The mango green tea was floral and flavorful, and my Okinawa milk tea was yummy and balanced. Boba was soft and fresh. The crepe was stuffed full of fruit and was good as well.

_YUcCnJXjUgkS9fSnNi0Ow,13,2013-05-25 08:19:51,10,TTAPHe0WMvAimFbLAQ5Krg,4,"So here's my take on Kuma Snow Cream.  It's a finely shaved ice creamish dish? The Taro Snow Cream I got was light, sorta icy, slightly creamy, but not as dense as ice cream but still full of flavor. The only small qualm I have about it is it reminds me of imitation ice cream and I'm wondering does it have any artificial flavoring? Aside from that I still enjoyed my dessert.   It's more 3.5 rounded up to a 4 cause I'm a fan of the flavors and toppings they carry here. 

What I Really Like About Kuma Snow Cream:

The snow cream stays colder longer. It didn't melt as fast as my frozen yogurt or ice cream usually does.
 
The exotic flavors they offer. Like Taro snow cream. Now all they need is Black Sesame!
 
Toppings hardly available at your typical froyo joint like Custard, Red Bean, Lychee, and Condensed Milk are provided here..... and I repeat now all they need is Black Sesame.

Reasonably priced. I got the ""Create Your Own"" Ninja sized 20oz  piled with three toppings and choice of sauce drizzled on top for $5.50. Now if I was at the yogurt place the same thing weight wise would've cost $2 more. So you get a pretty good value here! 

I like the cutesy names for the combinations they had.  ""Bruce Tea"" for the green tea chef inspired  snow cream creation. It sets the overall tone of the place as fun, light hearted, and family friendly. 

Where is Kuma Snow Cream:

Chinatown/Spring Mountain/Valley View vicinity your visual cue is the Starbucks. Parking is hit or miss depending on time of day you go.
 
The interior and service counter is small but the place is spacious enough to handle a large crowd. Seating area is limited to 3 (or was it four?) tables and some bar stools lined up along the wall.

The employees were friendly and all smiles and eager to help. Place your order and if you are dining in they will call your name when your order is ready.

Okay that's 1 visit down for me. 8 more to go till I get my free Sumo sized one from the punch card. Hopefully it will be a Sumo size cup of Black Sesame (hint hint)",15,2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg

In regards to food - I was pleased again!  I honestly had no idea if this would be a burger joint or a high-end dining experience.  It was much closer to the later, and we were delighted by the options.  I chose the scallops and my bf chose the lobster gnocci.  My scallops were amazing, finished off with a sweet and fruity sauce, that nicely complimented the dish.

And let me tell you, I walked into a SuperPawn Cash America last night JUST to get a quote on a loan, and my preconceived notions were definitely confirmed-- I was low-balled-- they offered 10% of what I got from Max Pawn. Take my words with a grain of salt, but you definitely have a bunch of different apples around town and Max Pawn is the good one in the barrel. 

I've been to this location twice now, once to sell electronic accessories I didn't need and just wanted cash for (and was too lazy to try eBay for), and once, now, to get a loan to help me through a difficult time. I am the worst possible person when it comes to remembering names, but two really kind and professional gentlemen helped me out when it came to checking my gear out, then processing the loan. 

Times are tough, and Max Pawn offered me two friendly experiences with non-judgmental people. For pawn shop newbies, the interest rate for a month is still applicable if you pay them back in a day. I plan to be repaying the loan in two weeks, and am confident my items will be well-stored and safe until I return.

It was average busy and we were seated relatively quickly.  Admittedly we were a big group (10).  Then a few more small groups came in and they asked us to move for a moment, and by moment they meant get up and go back to waiting so they could seat the other groups.  They had plenty of other seating, just too broken up to accommodate our group, but would have been fine for the others had I thought to make an issue of it before we were already up.

This is it!!! I worked out 5 days a week before I got pregnant with my son 6 years ago. 6 years I failed, bounced around work out locations and gyms. Hired high priced personal trainers and nutritionists. None of it gave me the boost mentally I needed. I started strong, then quit. For 6 years I didn't have a good pattern until I found inferno last October. I can't tell you how much it's changed my life. You have to experience it. All I can say is that each instructor makes you feel more powerful than you were yesterday. With every class, you see a change whether mental or physical. As soon as you walk through the door, you are greeted with someone who makes you feel so welcomed. The facility is so clean you could eat off the floor. Everyone who works out there is your support system. No judgement only positivity. I'm not close to where I want to be as far as losing weight. But, I can tell you without a doubt, my mind is as strong as it's ever been. My body is changing for the better and I'm doing moves that I've never been able to do in my life (weighing more than I did my entire life). I'm 40 pounds down with another 40 to go. But, I don't look at the scale. I look at my strength, my mental state of mind and the fact that tomorrow I know I'll be stronger than I am today. If I miss a day, I feel like something is missing in my life. Gabby and her instructors are the best there is. When you walk out of their door, you feel on top of your life. Nothing can compare to that feeling. If you're ready for a life changing work out, this is your place!

It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.  

Ordered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.

Pickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.

As for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....

Tried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.

Since all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.

I also tried the lychee with rosewater and raspberry curds on my second visit. It was very light, and fragrant. The ingredients mixed wonderfully together. I would highly recommend the london fog and the lychee for people who want to venture out of the standard vanilla/strawberry/chocolate flavours.

3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg,4,2012-02-07 01:36:42,6,GG2di6Jf6DQ9hjaKTv7w1A,5,"Let's start off with saying that I came here for a medical lecture with a group of about 35 people and was seated in one of the large dining rooms.

So without having to deal with many of the annoyances it seems other people have had, I was seated immediately and the service was impeccable from start to finish.
When I first walked in, my ears and eyes were immediately titillated. With the peppy live jazz that was playing in the background, I just kinda stood in awe and couldn't help but appreciate the opulence of the decorations. The thousands of wine bottles that adorn the bar, the leather walls, marble floors, hundreds of pieces of artwork and 6 foot handmade chandeliers just made it an amazing environment. I wasn't here to celebrate anything, but if I did indeed did have something to celebrate - this would be the place to live it up. 

I had heard that this place cost $6 million to make and let me tell you that this place does indeed look like $6 million. I do want to say that as spacious and grandeur this restaurant is, i completely agree with the statement ""this place is a collection of intimate spaces,"" made by the owner. You can seriously have as private of a dinner as you want in one area and go all out with 15 friends in another. It's amazing how versatile the environment is. I don't think I've ever raved this much about a restaurants' decor and atmosphere, so you gotta believe me. even if you're in the area and have to use a bathroom, come in take a sneak peak inside and you'll be blown away.

On to the food...if you like to to know how much the food costs before you order, you should not eat here. For two people, budget at least $200. I was lucky enough to not have to worry about the cost on this evening, but at the end of the night I did ask myself, ""If I had to pay (what probably amounted to $120 for just me) would I do it ?"" And I think it's a really tough call. If you're in a financial situation where you do not have to worry about budgeting - then absolutely. But just for a regular Friday night outing on the town - it would be hard for me to justify doing so.


What did I eat? I'll only give you a few because I tried a lot.

They start you off with a bread basket that has bread sticks, fig bread and crispy onion focaccia...i made the all too common mistake of chowing down on this before the actual meal...the onion focaccia was way too dangerous.

Rhode Island Calamari: Best calamari I have ever had. You have no idea how many times I get calamari that is too salty or too peppery or too mushy or too etc, this had the perfect consistency, just the right blend of spices and was complimented really well with the dipping sauce (i forget the type, sorry). Usually I love lemon on my calamari, but this time it was so good that I didn't dare cheat any of the flavor by adding lemon.

Filet Mignon (9 oz) - You can hear this bad boy sizzle as they place it front of you and it lies there just dripping with sweats of taste. I ordered mine medium and it came out as pink as I could have wanted it. So full of yum - every little bite was it's own flavor rocket. If you have a family history of heart disease, or suffer from high cholesterol, coronary artery disease or general obesity - you will most likely have a heart attack after eating this. I felt like I was a New York Yankee during my meal...so over the top good and expensive.

Creamed Sweet Corn (double corn)...this was by far my favorite. i never imagined creamed sweet corn to be such an amazing side dish - but it was so creamy and it did reset my palate after a few bites of filet. A completely different spin on corn - one that I've never experienced.

By the time dessert came, I think I stopped caring. I was too full to move. I think dessert was creme brulee, which was....wait for it...it's a surprise....it was also good. I are it in 3 bites are went home to go straight to bed. Sorry creme brulee, I chowed you down so quickly that I probably didn't appreciate how sweet, warm, and crisp you were.

This is the perfect place to be spoiled or spoil a special someone....but be prepared to drop some serious coin.",10,6p1NDChnIpGl29Ce3cMKWg

I went with family, so we had a group of 6 people and tried a lot of different items. We went on a Friday night. When we got there, we were seated immediately, but no one attended to us or took our drink order for about half an hour, which is when we finally asked someone to help us. 

First we were brought chips and two salsas. The salsas tasted as though they were watered down to save money. Icky. The chips were seasoned very well and tasted good, which is why I am giving I Love Tacos 1 star. 

We all ordered different things. Personally, I had the Cactus taco and a side of rice and beans. The cactus taco was horrible and not as described on the menu. The rice was dry and the beans were cold. I was not impressed. Everyone else did not enjoy their meals. They were cold, greasy, and lacking flavor. My friend ordered one of the sandwiches and the meat in it was quite odd looking and sketchy tasting. My dad has a couple of the signature tacos, including the Al Pastor, and thought they were flavorless and overcooked.

Our chips were not refilled without asking and kept needing to flag someone down to get service because our waiter was ignoring us.

My grandpa introduced my dad to Aloha Specialties when it was still located on the other side of the Cal Hotel. Some may think Aloha Specialties is a small location now, well from what I have heard their current location is a huge upgrade.

Aloha Specialties is located on the second floor of the Cal Hotel, right across from a snack shop and a chocolate shop. They have a small location with a decent amount of seats. However, their prices and food seem to draw a crowd so big that seating can get scarce. For the most part their lines literally go out the door. Worry not, the line tends to go quick and the food doesn't come that much later. You order upfront, pay and take your number to your table.

I have tried numerous things at Aloha Specialties and have a few recommendations.
I would definitely recommend the Combination Plate with pork, chicken and beef. It's only a dollar or so more than the bowl and its big enough to share with others. The plate comes with rice and a side of macaroni salad. All meats on this plate are flatten out and covered in teriyaki sauce. I enjoy every meat on this plate because they are all juicy and tender. 
I also recommend a bowl of Saimin, don't ask what's in it, just try it! 
Lastly, I recommend there Aloha Breakfast which comes with portuguese sausage, spam, eggs, rice and Hawaiian bread. Their portuguese sausage was pretty good, the spam wasn't bad but honestly you can't really go wrong with it, eggs are eggs, rice is rice, and the Hawaiian bread was yummy. 

Cheesy
Aloha Specialties is probably up there when it comes to a typical themed hawaiian restaurants. They have cheesy decor and random table cloths.

Overall
This restaurant isn't literally a 4 star restaurant. However, it's a 4 star overall. You get good ethnic food for a more than reasonable price.

It took a while for us to be greeted and after waiting for 5 minutes the bartender finally came over to help us. We received super yummy chips and salsa to start off with. I ordered the fish tacos and they were by far some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. I wish they had come with rice and beans or something but it was definitely enough food. Our server was cute and filled my iced tea several times without me asking. I'd definitely eat here again. It looks like a cute place to take a date!,3,06gL9VaAyAl6WoYVu_nPuA

I took my 8 year old daughter to Mapleside for the first time today, and she had a total blast for the 4 hours we were there!  The place was a bit crowded when we got there at 130PM, but there was more than ample parking across the street in a grassy lot (I hear weekends can be way too crowded, with long lines, especially around Halloween and if the weather is nice).  Police were there as well, directing pedestrians and traffic for safety (liked that).  This place is a huge, 100 acre or so family farm, with a gift shop, bakery, restaurant, snack stands, and concession stands.  There are many attractions for kids, since the focus is on them here.  Today, Friday was half price, and we got to walk through 2 really cool corn mazes (an amazing maize maze!), go on hayrides through endless orchards, tractor pulled kiddie cars in the shape of a pig or cow, go down a long slide that winds down a hill, walk through a pumpkin patch and pick pumpkins, jump on a huge inflatable in-ground air trampoline, go inside a tepee, and play in the park there.  The BEST part was when my little sweetheart hugged me 'out of the blue' as we were leaving and said ""dad, I had the best time today!  Can we come back again?""  ""Of course we can beautiful...

However the visit last night turned my thoughts around and got me lookin forward to going out to eat my one night I have a week! 
Josh our server was the best service I've had in a very long time.
Tip: there is a rib let's shortage so don't order that, but when I did, Josh was so apologetic and explained they didn't have it. When my honey asked for his sides he nicely explained it came with set sides but he'd be happy to substitute. Idk as of late we've had a lot of people telling us we were wrong or being almost condescending if we altered the menu. Either way Josh was phenomenal though he had 2 things negative happen to him right of the jump he recovered well and was clam and cool the whole time. We went in on Sat night around 9:30, tables were full and Josh had a larger section to cover. Didn't matter he came to our table dozens of times, told us where he was at in helping us, I mean just so attentive! He explained the touch pad and made it easy and convenient for us to order our appetizers. Being in customer service management I really, truly appreciate good service and recognize how much the country can lack these days. Oh yeah the food was great, we had great happy hour specials we didn't know were running so that was a nice surprise! Got 3 apps, 2 entree meals, & apparently it's $1 Bahama Mama month so take advantage of that.
We ate until we could eat anymore and still had left overs. Josh was quick to refill drinks, tell me what I ordered was his favorite (I love that) and get our to go boxes. He explained the pad for payment but still said he could take it if easier. I know how it works this cuts your time down and allows you to provide better service to everyone, we got you Applebee's. Go to this location. It's smaller but I like that, everyone was friendly and the food was cooked well! But this review was written mostly to give Josh the recognition he deserves for providing the very best Service out there...I recommended Applebee's, praise him and encourage him to stay with the co. Because he is why I will be returning to Applebee's and that location, and I will always ask for Josh. Though I hope he can make he way up because he worked hard and we loved it!

And the other burrito hardly had beans, a lot of rice though. Just thought it was odd to pay this price for a bean burrito I could have gotten at Taco Bell for way less money. It literally looked like a Taco Bell burrito. Unfortunately, we will just be going Carolinas. And it's a lot closer. Don't know if they changed cooks?

RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,2,2008-06-02 02:13:18,3,gU2x1aj93Fc6qua7HZZLZA,3,"Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  

Because I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.

So, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:

Pork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.

Smoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.

Pulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.

Sauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.

Corn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.

Cowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.

Soda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.

Price -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.

Overall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?",2,kc-rnN-ndnFTdHG4TfIgeQ

They no longer have the dart machine, which is a major bummer....but the food is great.  The owner is originally from Chicago and boy do I love Chi-town food!

By far, my favorite items are the Italian Beef Sandwich, Pizza, and of course the Pizza Puff.  The Italian Beef w/Giardinere is simply awesome.  The Pizza very good....thin crust and crispy, I order it Well Done.  The Pizza Puff is the legit ILTaco brand, which reminds me of the Windy City.

The employees here are super friendly and will try to accomodate you if you want to change a TV to watch your team play.

I always reserve and  get a seat at the bar.  

Prices range from 80, 100 and 120.   


I went with with $120 option and they change the menu based on what fish they have.   Most of the deluxe  is from Japan. 



Live lobster sashimi -  strong presentation 

Lobster soup-  flacour was a little weak


Sushi patter     mix of uni, sea trout and other

Sushimi   o Toro,  spot prawn and others

Godzilla egg      excellent and cooked to perfection. 

We opted for black seamee ice cream.    


it is not just the process or perpetuation of the fish that makes the difference it is there japonese cutting technique. That is the difference. 


I only go there ealry,  seated and order before 6; 45 pm.   If yiu go for high end sushi anywhere  they less than 20 seats,   they have 120 .   So they is why I seldom go for their regular menu, party more than 3 people  or busy time. If yiu do you may be DISAPPOINTED.

We were greeted and seated right away. The inside had been remodeled and had a much more open feel than before. The floors are now hardwood instead of carpet. Everything looked great except the Windows. Maybe they were due to be cleaned, but they were streaked and dirty. 

Our server came over, introduced herself and told us about a few items featured on the menu. We ordered the build your own French toast breakfast and one of the fit fare breakfasts. The food took awhile, but everything came out hot. 

The fit fare breakfast came with Turkey bacon, fruit, English muffin dry along with egg whites scrambled with spinach and tomatoes. Everything was delicious! The egg whites seemed a bit dry, but that may have been due to being cooked to be lower in calories. The turkey bacon was cooked just right. The fruit was a perfect mix of strawberries, bananas, grapes and cantaloupe! 

My daughter ordered their new multigrain French toast with caramelized pecans and cream cheese frosting. I had to have a couple bites. Okay, it was just sinful! Omg! Delicious!

The service was okay. They weren't that busy, but the food took quite awhile. Our server didn't come back after food was served to make sure everything was okay or to refill drinks.

When I was a student, the proximity to campus was fantastic.  And I don't know if it still exists, but there used to be sneaky-ninja parking behind the restaurant where I parked my car regularly and was never towed.  I am sure I went at least an entire semester without paying for on-campus parking because of this sneaky-ninja space.  

Also when I was a student, the affordability of this place and the fillingness (I'm not sure if that's a word but you get my meaning) of the meal was super appreciated.  

I can honestly say that I do not have any recollection of having bad service here, whether drive-through or dine-in, and again, that's going on many (many) years of coming here. 

The food always tastes fresh.  While the actual menu items are limited, the 'styles' are varied.  Check out the not-so-secret menu (per your favorite internet search engine) and you'll know what I mean.  

Me, I'm a tradionalist.  Double-double with grilled onions, light on the sauce, with fries and a Dr Pepper easy ice.  When I'm looking for a tasty burger-and-fries, I will default to this tried-and-true In-N-Out burger.",0,x2KHPyEmsg0VL3B40-xfDQ

Despite the crowdedness, the design of the restaurant didn't make it difficult to talk, even across the table, as some restaurants could be very loud. 

I loved that the order sheet shows pictures of some of the dim sums and the number that it corresponds with. I ordered the deep fried taro with quail egg because it looked interesting on the sheet. Taste-wise, I would say it is a step up from other dim sum places that I've tried. Even though there's a bit of a wait time for the dim sum, it is super fresh, hot, and delicious!

The only reason why I'm only giving it a four star is because they missed one of my orders--even when we circled it--and we were waiting for some time until we realized that it was left out.

We walk in and are waiting for about ten minutes before a host says, ""Oh, are you dining in?"" There was no one ahead of us and the restaurant was not busy, how did she not see us? We get seated and take a look at the menu. Another ten minutes pass before we see a server. She was really sweet but seemed new. She asks me if I want a dry rub on my wings. She explained it as they put dry rub on them before putting sauce on so I said sure. They came out with dry rub on them and nothing else, no sauce. Just covered in seasoning and fried, then covered with more seasoning. Pretty gross and unappetizing. 

We don't see her for quite a while. Our glasses are empty, one of my friends needs ranch, and our server is nowhere to be found. My boyfriend flags someone down, who ignores us. He gets our waiter who brings refills and ranch. She brought me the wrong drink, a Dr. Pepper instead of root beer. 

All in all, this place was pretty bad for a wing place. The service sucks, the wings are gross, the staff looks like they want to shoot themselves, it was not a fun dinner.

I found this place and am absolutely floored that Yelp let me down!  This wasn't a case of the kitchen having an off night.  I am honestly surprised that people enjoy any food coming from this place.

As we came here for wings, it was the first item on the menu I looked at.  There are 8 different flavors to choose from, but don't expect to ask for a sample.  Our waitress immediately stated that we couldn't sample any of the flavors without a $.50 per sauce surcharge.  When asked how hot, I was told they use Frank's Red Hot for their base.  Authentic and Original it ain't.  Portion size is either single or double, which is code for 10 (bone-in) or 20 wings.

I ordered Bone-In and my friends got Bone-less and Chicken Cajun Sliders.  The wings were typical frozen chicken.  The Bone-less were frozen breaded fare I could get from any grocery freezer.  They were dry and bland.  The sauce was definitely heavy on Red Hot, making this one wing experience you can safely skip.  The bone-in wings were average size, and not something I would expect at a buck a piece.  

The sliders were dry.  The chicken was dry.  The cheese was dry.  The sauce was not a help.  There are only 3 sliders on a plate.  And everything was plated with a HEFTY dose of French's fried onions.  I am not sure why, because they certainly weren't tasty, and added nothing to the meal.  Even the wings came on a bed of french fried onions.

You would think the atmosphere would have made up for the terrible food.  There are a ton of TVs and Big Screens, perfect for sports fans.  Plenty of comfortable tables, and 3 outdoor patios.  A large bar takes up most of the West side of the building.  But somehow, we were let down again.  During an obviously big game night, we waited 40 minutes for a table when there were a DOZEN open tables all evening.  There was enough people to fill the restaurant, but obviously mgmt wasn't able to staff the establishment properly.  As a consequence, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food order in.  Food did come promptly, but when  you are dumping frozen food into a fryer, this should be a no-brainer.

Carly's is awesome.  Let me make it clearer:  AWESOME 

Oh wait, you need to know why...Two words: JAZZ BRUNCH!  They have live jazz music for brunch.  Classy! 

Ok so if you can't make it to brunch because you don't get out of bed before 4, then you must try their caprese sandwich which will make an amazing late lunch or early dinner.  I seriously day dream about this sandwich.  I like it even more than their smoked salmon with creme fraiche and capers - which is my brunch go to.  Actually maybe it's a tie. I can't decide. 

I was here a week ago for first Friday and had their prickly pear margarita which was amazing!  

Also their wait staff are all really nice and friendly and make sure you get what you need when you need it and they are super apologetic if they make you wait more than three nano seconds for anything,  which is completely unnecessary but it's refreshing to hear because some other places I no longer frequent have horrible service.

Long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  We decided to stay at Palazzo.  We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.

SushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of ""This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done"".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.

As far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.

All said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",1,NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg

We had Ana and she was just about the coolest person I've ever met. Something about her personality just makes you feel very reassured that she knows what she's doing. My friend has a huge fear of needles and I was very impressed that Ana saw that as completely valid (though my other friend and I were giving our friend a hard time about it) and did everything she could to make her feel at ease. 

Ana was meticulous about having the correct spacing between the first piercing and the second, and making the second piercings look even, and had me and my other friend check her work. I was very impressed, when I got my doubles at Claire's it was nowhere near as detail oriented, oops! 

Then came time for my belly button, and it was great!! I am so happy with the way it turned out, I love the jewelry I bought (not exactly cheap but worth the price to not get an infection from crappy metal) and Ana did an excellent job placing the piercing in the right spot. I paid about $120 total, $40 for the piercing and $68 for the jewelry, plus tax. There are cheaper jewelry options available, I just chose to go with a sterling silver curved bar with CZ stones at both ends, which I imagine is on the pricey side, though they did have yellow gold options available. 

On a scale of 1-10, the pain was probably a 4. I've had bruises that hurt more than that did! Ana even said that cartilage hurts more, which I can see. The nice thing too is the only time it ever hurt was during the actual piercing, once the jewelry was in I could barely even feel that it was there! 

Super cute and I got it with enough time to heal a bit before summer swim season. Ana was very strict about not swimming but I started swimming 2 months after with no problems. I even went to Panama and swam in rivers with god knows what living in it, and the ocean, but still no infection! I will say though that chlorine dries out the skin a lot and pools harbor a lot of bacteria so be sure to clean it after swimming. 

Halo is the best and I recommend it to everyone I know!! Everything is super clean and the whole process is a well oiled machine and you really feel like these people know what they are doing. If I decided I want any more piercings, I will definitely go back!! Oh, and for all you teenagers out there, you get 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday (still have to buy the jewelry but hey that's a great deal).",0,19kyEIRvGYgxgIrc-FRGCg

       Extended Warranty offered by Spencer's:  AWFUL
I have purchased many appliances from Spencer's over the years for my home and two rental properties.  Their prices are very competitive with other stores.  Their salespeople are some of the most knowledgeable out there.  I know that extended warranties are usually not worth the money, but I don't want the hassle, and Spencer's does have the best prices if you do want to buy an extended warranty.
When I bought a new refrigerator for my own home a couple of  years ago, I purchased the 5 year extended warranty, for fear that I would have trouble with the in-door icemaker. 
Sure enough, the icemaker went out in May, 2015.  Only one adult uses the icemaker, so it is certainly not abused.  I called the warranty company that handles this.
     THIS WARRANTY COMPANY HAS BEEN TO MY HOUSE ELEVEN TIMES SINCE LAST MAY!  They have repaired or replaced just about every  part in my freezer.  At Thanksgiving (2015), they asked me to empty my freezer and defrost it, so they could replace a water line they believed was frozen.  I had to ask two neighbors if I could borrow some freezer space for a few days (this during Thanksgiving).  Not enough freezer space from the neighbors, so a lot of my food went into ice chests on the patio (some food just didn't make it).  After all of this, THAT repair did not work either.
They kept trying something new at each visit.  Each repair did not work.  Still no ice.
Finally, in early January, warranty company says they have tried everything.  They will order me a new door.  A new door??!??!?!  They PROMISED me a new door would take care of the problem. But, I would have to wait 2 months for Whirlpool to ship a new door.  I really like my refrigerator (I just want it fixed!!), so dumb me says OK.   In March (2016)  - Warranty company calls and says my new door is in (I have a side-by-side refrigerator).  FINALLY!  My nightmare will be over, and my every-other-day trip to the store for ice will end.  I can't wait.
Warranty company shows up and says ""Uh-oh. We ordered you a stainless-steel door, instead of black.  We are sorry.  You will need to wait ANOTHER two months for the correct door to be shipped from Whirlpool.""  When (or IF) I ever get the correct door, and IF that works, it will have been a total of ONE YEAR since I first reported my icemaker not working.
        In defense of the warranty company, the repair techs. have seemed truly sympathetic, and are very nice. But, this warranty policy is the worst.  (I happened to be in Sears the other day - they said their policy is to replace the ENTIRE appliance if it could not be fixed after 3 attempts to repair.)  
        My recommendation:  If you want just an appliance without any warranties, Spencer's has great prices and knowledgeable salespeople.  But, if you want to purchase an appliance with a warranty, you may want to shop around.  DO NOT buy the extended warranty from Spencer's.",5,c8ycEpcve95dIbUcWtHGJA

I haven't been to the AMC Centrium since AMC folded their Canadian operations.  As such there were only us and three other groups in the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.  This was common for all of the restaurants there.  The interior decor is great, with a lot of solid woodwork that makes you realize that a lot of work went into making this place.

We were seated promptly, and our waitress explained the daily specials to us.  I chose to have the guiness beef stew.  I almost always order beef stew at most Irish restaurants, but my Irish friends never serve beef stew at home.  I wonder why?

This stew actually had a little bit of a spicy pepper kick to it.  Nothing to set your taste buds on fire, but enough to make you take notice.

My vegetarian daughter managed to get one of the ""special"" pasta dishes without any of the meat as her meal, and the restaurant was kind enough to deduct a couple of dollars from the meal since they didn't have to give her meat.",1,oWgDURKIXQiSgpjZH9QkvA

My buddy and I went there for lunch, on a Thursday. Place was busy, but not too busy which was nice.  Menu is simple, much like the rest of the restaurant.  

I had the burrito which was huge and delicious!  Food had a very authentic taste to it as the staff working there were all Latino.  It's the authentic taste that separates it from comparables like Mucho Burrito and Taco Del Mar.  They use fresh ingredients that's looks to be all made in house and you can taste the difference.  They also have a self serve salsa bar so you slather your meal with as much or as little of the different salsas as you like.

The only downside is that is is more expensive than the comparable burrito joints in town, with most menu items around 12-15 bucks.  But since its local and not a franchise I don't mind

-Bread is served with olive oil and chili sauce.  Someone asked for balsamic vinegar, but the request was declined by the waiter.  I assume parmesan cheese was also out of the question.  *sniff* 
-Only Italian wines are offered.  I'm okay with that, it's cool to try something new.  Glasses range from $7-14.  They also offer half bottle and full bottle portions and have a large selection.

For my ""Primi"", I was deciding between the ravioli on the specials menu and the agnolotti.  I was curious to what agnolottis are, so I went with that.  They are like ravioli's, but shaped differently.

Agnolotti di Manzo con Burro e Salvia $ 17 - Handmade Agnolotti stuffed with braised beef in a butter, sage, and parmigiano Sauce.  This was quite delicious!  The pasta was light and fresh.  It wasn't saucy but nicely flavored.

C) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's, so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right, I don't trust you to do anything else right either). The meatballs weren't bad, but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs. The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store.

I paid approximately $60 for all-you-can-eat weekend brunch, without booze. As much as I love a good mimosa, I didn't want to fill up on liquid. We were here for food and we meant business. 
Reasons why I felt I got the full value of that $60 meal:
1. I went for the seafood first. You know that stuff is expensive and it is much less common in my life than some white or red meat. This means King crab legs, Cajun shrimp and grits, green mussels, lobster bisque, lox bagel  and lobster eggs benedict. Yes, I did eat all that.
2. The dishes are constantly being replaced with other dishes. I walked around 3/4 of the buffet every time I got another plate because where there was oatmeal and grits, there is now biscuits and gravy. Keep your eyes open and make sure to grab the things you really want before they're gone (they'll probably come back again but will you have space in your stomach by then? Doubtful).
3. Fancy cheeses and charcuterie! I made myself a personal plate that would cost at least $20 as an appetizer anywhere. Just take a slice of each. Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Oh and they had fresh honey and jams too! My cheese plate round was FANCY.
4. If you do have enough room to eat some more after you hit the best stuff, go for the classics. I got a slice of prime rib, huevos rancheros, Mac & cheese, and fried chicken. Again, take small pieces because you're going to want to try it all!

Two things I will say that go beyond how delicious the food was: I wish one alcoholic beverage was included. No I don't want bottomless mimosas for $15 but yes I would like one. Cheers. Second comment is the crepe line was hella long and only got longer. We were lucky and got in before the major crowds come (the difference between 10:50am and 11am, folks). Only one person makes crepes on two burners. Each takes a good minute or two. Do the math, it's going to be a wait. If you want a crepe, even for later, go if there isn't too much of a line. Or don't go at all. They looked really good but I wasn't willing to wait ~20 minutes.

Overall, delish. I'm very happy with my six rounds of food and wouldn't change a thing (except to get ONE mimosa if they ever decide to offer that).",2,8ahrzebmEdp8NASJom9Izw

This place is 1/2 the price of Bacchanal and you can expect the quality of the food to be halved as well. 

On their website, Studio B claims that you can ""enjoy over 200 dishes daily"", which is absolutely true. However, please note that half of these dishes are simply variations of different salads (Caesar Salad, Greek Salad, Sweet Potato Salad, Chinese Shrimp Salad, Sautéed Kale & Strawberries etc.), which may be disappointing if you're expecting the majority of dishes to consist of meat.  

Studio B does offer unlimited beer and wine, which is unique. During my visit, they had a berry wine cooler, Stone Pale Ale, Rolling Rock and others on tap. 

Im not a picky eater, but most of meat dishes were overcooked and incredibly dry. Also, the sushi selection was not grand.

If you're looking for a cheaper buffet ($25) and nothing too fancy, then Studio B would be a good choice.",0,3fpLB4PADEQQb73FCGseeQ

So RCK does small pita sandwiches with different fillings and different styles/flavours. You choose your protein, and then your flavour profile (Egyptian, Greek, Lebanese, among others). My favourite is the Lebanese (garlic sauce and pickles) with halloumi cheese. They grill it on the flat top which makes it crispy and warm. Yum! I haven't tried their fries but I've had the Moroccan salad, and I didn't like it very much...Maybe it was just my palate and that's how it's supposed to taste, but it simply didn't taste right. It was too tangy and the seasoning seemed off; unbalanced, although it was filled with really good stuff like chickpeas and couscous. That was a thumbs down for me. Portions are pretty small which are perfect for me but someone else may need 2 pitas to be satisfied. 

The food is a definite 4-star but something about the place makes me uneasy. Service has been pretty spotty as other people have mentioned, and I never really feel welcomed into the place. Staff behind the counter always seem a little bored or resentful to be there and take my order almost scathingly. And now that someone has mentioned it, I have encountered the owner more than once and she never seems like a happy person... Kinda brings the place down. I think the vibe and the attitude of the place needs some work.

We are long time Verizon wireless customers and unfortunately due to what I call lies told to us by Verizon corporate and Verizon's store manager we are left with no alternative but to terminate our relationship. After being loyal customers for many many years. 

Our relationship with Verizon took a severe turn for the worse after being told by a representative from corporate one thing and then something totally opposite from a store manager. I'm not sure when the disconnect occurred between corporate and store manager but this company just can't seem to get their stories straight. 

 Very upset to have to leave Verizon but over the last few weeks iv been told nothing but great things from peers and fellow business owners about T-MOBILE and as hard as it's going to be we are making the switch. Like I told the rep on the phone we will fight any future bills they plan on sending and we are returning all original equipment to the store as Verizon wireless was the one who broke contract. I would love to go into further detail but it's best I get legal advice as the consumer has rights. Contracts are to be atleast it's my understanding, upheld by all parties that enter into agreement. Verizon wireless in my eyes has failed to do so. 

I will say the most hurtful of it all is going into the store on 44th street to pick up a new added device to our account we did over the phone with corporate only to be told their are additional fees and fees and fees. Our account is not past due as we been complying with our debt monthly. Being such a long time customer it's even a bigger slap in the face to have an answer to a question delivered in such a manner it leaves you second guessing if your the one at fault. Fortunately for me I was able to see a new potential customer ask the same question and get such a warm inviting response. I treat others how I would like to be treated and expect atleast an effort from those in customer service to reciprocate. 

Please heed my advise based on my review that you should take serious consideration before walking into Verizon. Check all your options as the competition has gotten to be just as good if not better from what hear.",1,j7Rgozl24WrmDeqFCCKwQg

So first with the wait time: we have a party of five so we go to the front desk and give them our phone number. They text us when our table is ready. Wait time was about 45 minutes and it was a Saturday night in Las Vegas so it was pretty busy. 

We started off with some onion rings and truffle parmesan fries. The fries were a bit chewy on the outside but still crispy. It comes down to personal preference but I prefer the crisper fries from Umami Burger. The truffle aioli is very good and is on par with Umami.

I highly recommend the beer battered onion rings. Very crispy and delicious and beats out many other places. Now on to the burgers.

I ordered the farm burger with the duck breast bacon and egg on top and cooked medium. It was very tasty and the iconic bun with black and normal sesame seeds is eye catching. Presentation wise I 
love the burger. Extremely well done and clean.  

For dessert we got the Oreo shake with creme brule and the push up ice cream tops. Very good desserts but the dessert selection is limited. We still enjoyed it.

We hit up Raku again now that they've expanded, allowing a few more people to experience this fantastic place at a single time.  Do yourself a favor and don't walk in - you likely won't get a table.  Even on a Tuesday, at 6PM.  They're likely booked to 11 by then.  Reserve your table a day or so in advance and get in your 2 guaranteed hours of amazing food and intimate setting.

This time, we once again ordered the Agedashi Tofu, because... you can't NOT order it.  Even if you don't like tofu, you will love this dish.

A special we tried this time were the small fresh crabs, lightly fried and served posed on a small long dish, as if they're in a little procession of deliciousness... right into your mouth.  They're maybe each as big as a 50 cent piece.  You pop the entire thing into your mouth and chew.  In a word - amazing.  I'm not a big crab lover, but these were tasty, well seasoned, and delicious.  The shell on them is so light there's no worry of impaling your mouth with a piece of them.  My wife devoured them and we almost ordered seconds.  She talked about them on the way home.  The next day.  Just order them if they're available.

The core dishes that we re-visited from our previous trips are still excellent.  This time we also got 3 sake tasting special to sample with the meal and I was impressed not only with the choices (a filtered, an unfiltered, and a flavored one) but how inexpensive it was for the sampler ($14).  A good value and more than enough to keep a great mood through your meal.

As an update to my last post, I must say that Raku's desserts are quite excellent.  We've tried the different sorbets, the melty chocolate cake, the bubbly milk pudding, and they've all been wonderful.  Now if they only offered a Honey Toast dessert....

The sandwiches are also really good too.  I haven't tried the coffee or gelato but I'm sure its as good as everything else.",0,Cqp2IV1zwcNNqnkhdznJEA

Or boy has a chronic undiagnosed sinus condition and our main coone requires regular grooming. Our first visit with our boy solidified this was THE BEST veterinarian we had ever been to. Our poor boy had gone 5 years with multiple vets saying he had a sinus condition of some type. Scaredy Cat conducted a few tests (only ones absolutely necessary so to not gouge me) and definitively found he has herpes!! This effects his sinuses, not curable but easy to treat when he has flare ups. After a few days on the meds our cat, we nicknamed snarfy, had no nasal issues. We both cried during our follow up visit that they fixed our baby. Beyond this everyone there is amazing. They go above and beyond to provide superior service. We drove 45minutes each way to go there with no regrets.
I am very picky in vets and now that we moved to Portland I worry about not finding anything comparable to Scaredy Cat.
Thank you Melanie, Dr. Wood (she solved our boy's illness, Dr. Grant (so patient even when our boy sprayed him) and ALL of the staff at Scaredy Cat. We love you all and will miss you!",0,65HETxu3epHRChM0oBsO9A

I tried the cupcake thing (ube cake topped with flan) and the Bundt cake. Flan was a little on the tough side. Both cakes were pretty dense and not that moist. Not too sweet, but I actually liked that aspect.

My dad ordered the halo-halo. Thank you for having really fine ice in this drink. Had it in San Diego and wasn't into the frozen ice chips. Ufff.

The workers were quite friendly and welcoming. The venue was casually hip and comfortable.

But as a dessert-maker myself, the place was not that memorable for the food.",0,MbuUxuPQ1VltBC9trVVlBQ

We had a group of 6 and shared 3 appetizers: Caprese salad (with heirloom tomatoes!!), Caesar salad, and blue cheese salad. All were excellent! For my main meal, I got the linguine with clams - this was great too. I also tasted the spaghetti with meatballs, which had homemade pasta cooked perfectly al-dente. I would order this next time as the sauce was amazing. My friend got the ribeye steak, which was realllly good too. 

It was my friend's birthday and they brought a sample of Nutella tiramisu dessert, which was SO GOOD. If I wasn't so full after the meal, I would order more of this dessert!

The atmosphere is sophisticated and classy. The wait staff was very professional and has great service. 

If you want a semi-fancy, high quality Italian meal in Vegas, then I highly recommend coming here!",0,RWCN0e2RQ9GO-wrZ3rHYYA
HYBmdPOsCUlDSFKs75Pbvg,3,2018-06-22,0,MNFXDAz2CwBHFSmtVMcIRw,1,"Do not, I repeat, do NOT rent a car from this place. If you are flying into Toronto and expecting this car rental to be in the airport, it is not. If you're flying international, you will have to take a shuttle to a different terminal and then call them to be picked up. 
I was aware of the need to be picked up, however I was not aware of needing to find the shuttle and take it to a different terminal.
I was also not aware of the need to have proof of car insurance, otherwise being forced to buy car insurance from them. Interestingly, this policy only applied to me. As I spoke to other unhappy renters, they were not being forced into purchasing insurance. They were however being charged for pre-existing scratches on the car. And had to go through an ordeal of proving it. The service rep didn't even bother pulling up the initial paperwork before abusing the renter of scratching the car. Another story I heard was a renter being charged a $1000 hold, instead of the standard $500. But I guess there is no standard procedure here. Reps do as they please? 
Another irk is getting the car with half a tank and needing to return it the same. I have never heard of a car rental requiring a half a tank of gas upon return. Honestly feels like a scam as well, you'll either overfill for them or come a little bit under and likely get charged for it. 
Failure on my part was not checking yelp before booking. And since you're reading this review, you didn't make the same mistake. Good for you!",4,uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg

We couldn't be happier with our selection!  Jason really listened to the look we were going for and gave us some great advice.  He's truly an expert at what he does.  Thanks Jason!,0,_wjLzhrh_HOSb0y_WWGZaA
